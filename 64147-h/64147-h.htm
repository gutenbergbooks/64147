<p class="no-indent bold center p1"><em>Not a Dull Book in This List</em></p>

<p class="no-indent bold center p1">ALL BY NICHOLAS CARTER</p>


<p class="p2">Nick Carter stands for an interesting detective story. The fact
that the books in this line are so uniformly good is entirely due to
the work of a specialist. The man who wrote these stories produced
no other type of fiction. His mind was concentrated upon the creation
of new plots and situations in which his hero emerged triumphantly
from all sorts of troubles and landed the criminal just where
he should be—behind the bars.</p>

<p>The author of these stories knew more about writing detective stories
than any other single person.</p>

<p>Following is a list of the best Nick Carter stories. They have been
selected with extreme care, and we unhesitatingly recommend each of
them as being fully as interesting as any detective story between cloth
covers which sells at ten times the price.</p>

<p>If you do not know Nick Carter, buy a copy of any of the New
Magnet Library books, and get acquainted. He will surprise and delight
you.</p>

<br />
<small>THE BEGINNING OF A PLOT.</small></h2>


<p>Bare-Faced Jimmy, so-called gentleman crook, expert
cracksman, and a master criminal in any department
of the underworld to which he cared to devote
his attention, leaned backward in his chair until it
tilted against the wall behind him, blew a cloud of Perfecto
smoke ceilingward, and remarked:</p>

<p>“It will be the easiest thing in the world, Juno. If
the objective point were a fortune—even a moderate
one; if the thing contemplated included the theft of
a single dollar, in cash or in estate, it would be different;
but it doesn’t. No, it does not. Really, Juno, if
one pauses to think seriously about it, from that point
of view, it is almost laughable.”</p>

<p>“That is why I have been smiling at the idea ever
since you mentioned it,” returned the woman, applying
a lighted match to a cigarette with all the grace and
abandon of one who had been long accustomed to the
practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“As a matter of fact,” Jimmy continued, as if he
had not heard her remark, “if I do decide to undertake
it, the only things that I steal will be a lot of
debts; and who ever heard of stealing debts? Eh?”</p>

<p>“There certainly is novelty in the thought,” was the
quick reply. “If some gracious person had done you
the honor to steal yours, long ago——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, my dear; that is quite true; only we won’t
go into the ‘long ago’ matters, just now, if you please.”</p>

<p>The woman shrugged her shoulders and picked up
from her lap a book that she had been reading. For
a time she devoted her attention to the pages, and then
her companion broke the silence again.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll do it,” he said decidedly. “I see great
possibilities in the adventure. Juno, will you be good
enough to lay that book aside for a few moments, and
to give me your undivided attention?”</p>

<p>“Gladly,” she replied, “if you will condescend to
speak out plainly, instead of confining yourself to
generalities.”</p>

<p>“All right, my dear; here goes. In the State of
Virginia, bordering on the Potomac River, and
washed by the waters of two other streams—which
by courtesy are also called rivers—lies an estate which
consists of something more than eight hundred acres.
The title to that estate is in the name of James Ledger
Dinwiddie, who——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who, at the present moment lies dead in the adjoining
room in this house,” she interrupted him;
but he only chuckled as he responded:</p>

<p>“On the contrary, he is seated here before you,
now; he is talking with you; he is referring to that
dear old plantation in dearer old Virginia which, ever
since the days of Bushrod Washington, has been called
by the name of Kingsgift—the Lord only knows why,
unless some dead and forgotten king gave it as a present
to the original Dinwiddie. Henceforth, my dear,
I am Ledger Dinwiddie, owner of an estate in Virginia
that is mortgaged for more than it was ever
worth; for much more than it would ever bring at a
forced sale. I am also the undisputed owner of a
choice collection of debts, of an old colonial house
that is now falling into ruins, of numerous other buildings
that are in various stages of dilapidation, and of
numerous other things of the same sort, all of which
are not only entirely worthless, but are really much
worse than worthless; and there you are.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell me, Jimmy, just what you expect to
gain, then, by this remarkable adventure, as you call
it?” the woman asked quizzically.</p>

<p>“Decidedly I will tell you. I gain the one thing
I need most, just now—a name. My own—but I have
never told you what my own really was, have I? No;
and there is no use going into that, now—but my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
name has been so long abandoned that I have forgotten
the use of it; especially the application of it. The
name that has been given me by the police of various
localities, isn’t sufficiently high-sounding; and——”</p>

<p>“No. Bare-Faced Jimmy is hardly a name to have
engraved upon one’s cards,” she interrupted him.</p>

<p>“——and, as I was saying, James Duryea, who has
been called Bare-Faced Jimmy, is popularly supposed
to lie buried on an island in the Sound, just off South
Norwalk, Connecticut. I would much rather that the
police should not be undeceived about that, and so we
will let Jimmy Duryea, cracksman, lie there and rot;
eh?”</p>

<p>“If you please. I don’t mind. A rose by any other
name, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I know. And that reminds me. In the future
I will thank you to address me as Ledger. Eh?
By Jove! Juno, that chap in there was the most unbalanced
ledger I ever saw in my life. If he hadn’t
sort of come to, during the last hours of his life, and
told all he ever knew about himself and his people, this
idea would never have occurred to me.”</p>

<p>“It looks to me like a fool idea, anyhow,” she commented,
with a toss of her beautiful and shapely head,
crowned as it was with a wealth of raven-black hair.
Juno was undeniably a beautiful woman—a fact of
which she was perfectly well aware.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fool idea?” he retorted. “Not much. It’s a splendid
one. It is the idea of my life, and it is worth about
three or four times as much as it would have been
had the chap in there left a million in money and unencumbered
estates behind him when he died. I would
rather have his debts than a fortune that he might
have left. Really, I don’t think that I would have undertaken
the thing if he had left property that was
worth anything.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Why, to what, Juno?”</p>

<p>“Why is the name and the identity of that poor fellow
worth more to you, so, than if he had left a fortune
behind him?”</p>

<p>“Why? Can you, my dear, ask such a question as
that?”</p>

<p>“I do ask it.”</p>

<p>“Then know this: Nobody will want what Dinwiddie
has left behind him. No one will be desirous
of shouldering his debts; and consequently nobody
will step forward to dispute the rights that I shall
assert belong to me. Word will travel around the
neighborhood, and throughout the county, that Ledger
Dinwiddie has come back; then there will be a few convulsive
shrugs of a few shoulders, a score or so of
knowing winks—and that will be about all. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
other hand, if there was property, there would be a
hundred disinterested persons, neighbors and otherwise,
who would find a chance to doubt if I were the
real Dinwiddie returned to what had once been his
own.”</p>

<p>“But what do you get out of it, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“I get a name, my dear; an old, old name; an older
lineage, than which there is none better in the Old
Dominion; an ancestry that is unimpeachable; a reputation
which stands for gentility, and which has stood
for gentility for generations; a career, all made in a
moment, but which is, nevertheless, three centuries old;
an established place in the world which none can deny
me—Heaven knows that I need one just now; and a
safe refuge in which I can hide myself for the rest of
my natural life, without the trouble of attempting to
disguise my face, or my mannerisms.”</p>

<p>“All the same, Jimmy, there are plenty of people in
the world, honest men and crooks, policemen and
judges on the bench, lawyers and ex-convicts, who will
quickly recognize the features of Jimmy Duryea, if
those features happen to be seen.”</p>

<p>“Juno, that is just the point; they won’t. Ledger
Dinwiddie will bear a strong resemblance to the late
lamented Bare-Faced Jimmy, to be sure, but nobody
will ever think of associating the two; never. Besides,
if the necessity should arise, Ledger Dinwiddie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
could establish his identity beyond question. People
could be found who knew him when he was a boy.”</p>

<p>“And you might even claim, if you choose, that the
defunct Jimmy was a distant relation who went to the
bad in his early youth, and who had been cast off by
‘the family,’” said Juno.</p>

<p>“Precisely. Not at all a bad idea.”</p>

<p>“Well, what then?”</p>

<p>“Everything then, Juno. Like Monte Cristo, the
world will be mine. I will only have to reach out
my two hands and take it. And with my accomplishments
I do not anticipate that it will be a difficult task
to do so.”</p>

<p>“Probably not—with your accomplishments.”</p>

<p>“It will never occur to any of those Virginians, up
there, that a man would be ass enough to lay claim
to a worthless estate, encumbered by unnumbered
debts; to a broken fortune—and all that. They will
accept me on the spot, and without asking a question.”</p>

<p>“Yet, Jimmy, you do not in the least resemble that
dead man in there.”</p>

<p>“I know it. What of it?”</p>

<p>“There may be a few persons left alive, at or near
Kingsgift, who will remember the young man who
left his home in Virginia, so long ago.”</p>

<p>“Bah! Nonsense, my dear. They will look at me
and exclaim. ‘How you have changed!’ or, ‘You’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
right smart altered since you went away, Ledger.’
But to offset that, there will be dozens who do not remember
at all how Dinwiddie really looked, who will
declare, ‘Why, boy, I’d have known you anywhere.
You ain’t a mite changed since you was a leetle chap,
so high.’ That is the way of the world, Juno.”</p>

<p>“But what will you do with the name, and with the
mortgaged estates, when you get them?” Juno asked
lightly. “Considering that part of it as settled, for
you generally accomplish whatever you undertake to
do, what will you do with it all?”</p>

<p>“I’ll make your fortune and mine. I’ll square Dinwiddie
with the people around there, and tell them
all what a great man I intend to make of myself. I’ll
pay off a year’s interest on the mortgages and other
debts, and make out new papers, just to give them confidence
in me. When that is done, I’ll be ready for the
real work of—succeeding.”</p>

<p>“Succeeding at what?”</p>

<p>“At making a fortune.”</p>

<p>“And you really think that you can do it?”</p>

<p>“With such a name, such a lineage, such a reputation
for gentility? Of course I can do it.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t strike me that people will be any more
eager to lend you money——”</p>

<p>“Lend me money? I don’t want them to do that.”</p>

<p>“Then how——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“I shall take it. If they accept me, they must take
the consequences.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you will do it in the old way?”</p>

<p>“Sure. What other way do I know?”</p>

<p>“What if you should get caught at it, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“Caught at it? Ledger Dinwiddie caught at burglary?
At thievery? What an absurd idea! Oh, no,
I won’t get caught at it. Not at all. And the world
will open itself wide, inviting me to take it. I’ll have
a winter home for you, in Washington; I’ll get those
fools to send me to Congress, and—— You’ll see!”</p>

<p>Such was the beginning of the “Great Coup” undertaken
by James Duryea, alias Bare-Faced Jimmy, the
gentleman crook, alias Howard Drummond, one-time
gentleman, graduate of Rugby and Cambridge, ex-officer
in the dragoons, and ex- a lot of other things
which had come to him by inheritance.</p>

<p>But Jimmy had run the gamut of his short, but
varied career.</p>

<p>Nothing had been too swift for him to overtake it,
to distance it, and finally to wear out its usefulness,
and finally his own, too.</p>

<p>Once, according to Nick Carter’s records, the man
had really tried to reform; “had made a stab at it,” as
he expressed it; but the old temptations had been too
strong for him; the “call of the contest” had proved
too alluring. The desire to pit his own wit against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the representatives of law and order had overcome
the better self that reposed somewhere within the
strange complexity of this man, and he had gone
again, deliberately, into the life of the underworld.</p>

<p>The woman who was seated upon the chair opposite,
and to whom his conversation was addressed, had
proved herself to be the only person of whom Jimmy
had ever stood in the least in awe.</p>

<p>The name by which Jimmy addressed her, was one
that he had bestowed upon her himself.</p>

<p>She had never been known by that name to any
other person than this man who had just determined
to steal a birthright, although there were half a dozen
aliases by which she had been known to the authorities
of Paris, Vienna, Berlin, St. Petersburg, and London;
and under each one of those half dozen aliases
she had earned reputations which filled pages of private
but official records of the secret police of five
different nations.</p>

<p>Her dossier had been written down in five languages—and
more; and now, as Juno, she had started out to
carve a new career for herself, with the aid of Jimmy,
whom she respected for his wit, his daring, for his
past achievements and the promise he gave of attempting
new and greater ones.</p>

<p>These two represented the masculine and the feminine
of all that is masterful in the life of rogues; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
were the perfection of the imperfect, if the expression
may be used.</p>

<p>Jimmy was a handsome man, and one who would
be noticeable in any company. He was distinguished
in appearance, Chesterfieldian in his manners, graceful
in his motions—a somebody in everything that he
did, educated, refined by instinct and by early training;
he was a graduated crook in every part and branch of
the “profession.”</p>

<p>And Juno? Draw her picture for yourself. It cannot
be too strongly, too perfectly outlined.</p>

<p>She was of that type of beauty which only the Latin
races achieve, and it had been vouchsafed to her in
the superlative degree. Her hair was black, beautiful,
and there were masses of it. Her complexion was
almost fair, but there was just enough of the olive
tint to give to the red blood in her cheeks an added
warmth. Her eyes were large, luminous, dreamy, or
ablaze with eagerness or passion as the case might be.
Her figure was perfect, her hands and her feet were
“dreams for the contemplation of an artist,” her
every motion was lithe, lissome, sinuous, catlike in the
sense that she could not have been lacking in grace had
she made the effort. Indeed, there was something about
Juno’s every act which suggested the black leopard—and
that was one of the aliases by which she had
one time been known in Paris. Reduced to five words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Juno’s description was entirely comprehended by the
expression: She was a beautiful woman.</p>

<p>Juno’s antecedents were no less aristocratic than
Jimmy’s.</p>

<p>She, too, had been born and bred within the exclusiveness
of the blue-blooded. Her father and her
mother had worn titles of distinction; she had been
given all the “advantages” when she was a child, and
a young woman—she was that, still. She spoke many
languages, and spoke each one so perfectly that it was
a matter of indifference to her which one she made
use of.</p>

<p>In the long-ago, when both had been respectable
children, she and Jimmy had played together. Many
years after that, when Jimmy had gone to the bad, and
Juno had achieved an international reputation in her
various lines, they met again—to drift apart as they
had done in those early days.</p>

<p>After that there was another lapse of years during
which Jimmy had visited South Africa, had married,
had drifted to New York with his wife, had been
sent to Sing Sing, had been divorced, and then, according
to official reports concerning him, had died
and was buried on an island in Long Island Sound.
During these years Juno had served the Nihilists of
Russia, the Socialists of Germany, the secret societies
of other nations—during which she had been a spy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
also, for these several governments, and had won an
international reputation, and become almost everything
that a beautiful woman should not be.</p>

<p>But the continent of Europe, and the British Isles,
had grown too hot for her. She came to America—and
almost the first person she encountered after leaving
the steamer that brought her here, was Bare-Faced
Jimmy. And this happened within the year
that followed upon his supposed death.</p>

<p>“Two souls with but a single thought,” although by
no means a sentimental one, might well have applied
to them; the single thought being their desire to victimize
the rest of mankind.</p>

<p>“Let’s strike up a partnership, Juno,” Jimmy had
said to her. “Together, with your craftiness and my
skill, nothing can stop us. Let’s strike up a partnership;”
and she had replied:</p>

<p>“Very good, Jimmy; but a minister, not a lawyer,
shall draw the contract.”</p>

<p>And so they were married—strangely enough, under
their right names, too.</p>

<p>Jimmy had more than twenty thousand dollars
cached away in a secret hiding place; Juno possessed
half as much more. The marriage occurred in the
late fall, and they went South, to one of the Florida
beaches, where they secured a villa, and where they
passed what was really a honeymoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>When issuing from their cottage door one morning,
they had found the insensible form of a man upon their
doorstep.</p>

<p>One may be a crook, a burglar, and all that, and still
possess much kindness of heart; two may be so, and
these two were.</p>

<p>Together they carried their unconscious burden inside
the cottage, summoned the one servant who
waited upon their wants, and attended to the stricken
man.</p>

<p>They did not ask where he came from, nor how it
happened that he had fallen upon their doorstep in
his present condition; and he could not have informed
them, then, if the questions had been asked.</p>

<p>But they ministered to him; they kept him there and
cared for him, making no inquiries concerning him,
since by doing so they would have attracted attention
to themselves, which was the one great thing they desired
to avoid.</p>

<p>But the stricken man had arrived at the end of his
journey. He had fallen upon their doorstep to die,
and die he did, after three weeks, easily, painlessly,
composedly, and tenderly cared for until the last, by
these two bits of flotsam.</p>

<p>And there had been some hours of clearness of
vision, of return to memory, before death claimed its
prize. He had told them his name, and all about himself—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
also that nowhere in the world did there remain
one person who was nearly enough related to
him to care whether he lived or died; that he was the
last of his race, in the direct line, and that he bore an
old and honored name upon which there had never
been a blemish, save that one which poverty imposes.</p>

<p>Ledger Dinwiddie died in the spare bedroom of that
cottage inhabited by these two products of the underworld,
cared for during his last hours by two as uncompromising
crooks and rogues as ever lived to prey
upon mankind.</p>

<p>And so, Ledger Dinwiddie did not die, but lived on
again in the person of Bare-Faced Jimmy, who adopted
the name and the lineage of his uninvited guest, and
who went forth, presently, to assume all the prerogatives
which the possession of that name could bestow
upon him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.
<br />
<small>BACK FROM THE DEAD.</small></h2>


<p>“It was four years ago, wasn’t it, Chick, when Bare-Faced
Jimmy kept us guessing? You remember Jimmy
Duryea, don’t you?” asked Nick Carter of his first
assistant, as he lighted a cigar immediately after breakfast,
one Monday morning.</p>

<p>“Remember him? I should say I do!” replied Chick,
as he selected a cigar from the box on the table. “Bare-Faced
Jimmy! The mere mention of that name, Nick,
calls up a great many recollections. And that reminds
me; I wonder what has become of Nan Nightingale.
I have not seen a line about her in any of the papers
lately. Has she left the stage?”</p>

<p>“I saw her last evening, at church or, rather, just as
we were coming out of church,” replied the detective.
“That was why I asked the question.”</p>

<p>“You saw Nan?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and talked with her.”</p>

<p>“And her husband—Smathers was his name, wasn’t
it—did you see him, too?”</p>

<p>“No. Smathers—The Man of Many Faces, as he
called himself on the vaudeville stage—is dead. He
died about a year and a half ago, Nan told me. Jimmy
Duryea was her first husband, you know. She got a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
divorce from him when he was sent to prison, and
afterward married Smathers. Smathers has been dead
more than a year, and Nan thinks that Jimmy is still
alive.”</p>

<p>“Jimmy Duryea alive? Impossible.”</p>

<p>“That is what I told her; but she insists that she saw
him—or his ghost.”</p>

<p>“Then it must have been his ghost, Nick. Jimmy has
been dead four years. He died soon after you took him
off that island in the Sound, near South Norwalk,
didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“That was the supposition. That has always been
my belief. Do you remember that last stunt of his,
Chick?”</p>

<p>“The time he passed himself off as Paran Maxwell,
do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I think we all have cause to remember that incident.
Bare-Faced Jimmy was a remarkable chap, Nick, take
it all in all.”</p>

<p>“He certainly was. There was a great deal of good
in Jimmy. You remember there was a time when I
thought he had entirely reformed. Then he made
that disappearing act of his from the steamship, and
bobbed up, long afterward, on that island. It would
be strange if he should appear again, after four years,
wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“It certainly would; but stranger things than that
have happened in our experiences, Nick.”</p>

<p>“Yes. But, somehow, I can’t believe that Jimmy
Duryea is alive, now; although Nan is positive
about it.”</p>

<p>“Tell me what she said. Tell me about your talk
with her. I always liked Nan; and it is a cinch that
she <em>could</em> sing. You gave her the right name when you
called her Nightingale.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Even Pettis said that.”</p>

<p>“Why did she give up the stage?”</p>

<p>“She didn’t tell me that. I was coming out of the
church when some one touched me on the arm, and
turning about I saw that it was Nan. Of course I was
glad to see her, and I said so.”</p>

<p>“Naturally. She is a sort of protégée of yours, you
know. It was through you, Nick, that she quit being
a crook and became an honest woman.”</p>

<p>“Softly, Chick. Nan was never really a crook, you
know. When she was Jimmy Duryea’s wife he did
force her into assisting him in some of his crooked
work; but she never had any heart in it. She hasn’t
left the stage permanently—only temporarily. She
said she desired a rest for a season, and that she had
saved up enough money to take it. I guess that is her
only reason for not being on the boards at present.”</p>

<p>“But what about Jimmy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is rather an odd sort of story, but I will tell
it to you just as she told it to me and see what you think
about it, Chick.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“During her career on the stage these last four years,
Nan has made some splendid acquaintances. I am
not referring to people in the ‘profession’ so much as
to society people. Nan has become a welcome guest
at many an exclusive house, and among the members
of the most conservative set.”</p>

<p>“I’m not surprised at that. She is a beautiful woman—there
is not another one on the stage who can hold
a candle to her, if it comes down to that.”</p>

<p>“You’re right. She is a lady, through and through—to
the manner born, so to speak.”</p>

<p>“Sure. And by the way, isn’t that what Jimmy used
to say to himself—that he was ‘born, bred, and raised
a gentleman’?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And it was true, too.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead about Nan, Nick.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was at the solicitation of some of her
society friends that she decided to take a rest for one
season. She has saved up a lot of money, as nearly as
I can make out, and was invited on a yachting cruise
with some of her friends. After that she became the
guest of Mrs. Theodore Remsen—and that is where
she is staying now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“She did get into the ‘upper ten,’ didn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Sure. There isn’t a more exclusive house in the
city, or at Newport or Lenox, than the Theodore Remsen’s.”</p>

<p>“I know. Well?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you know that the Remsens also own a
fine residence that fronts on the Hudson River, eh?
Not far from Fishkill?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it; but that makes no difference.
What about it?”</p>

<p>“That is where they are staying just now; and Nan
is there with them. She is to be their guest until
spring. I believe there is a whole season of pleasure
mapped out for Nan, and she is to be made quite the
lioness—and all that.”</p>

<p>“I understand. But what has all that got to do
with——”</p>

<p>“I am coming to that, Chick. That is what brings
me to the rather remarkable tale that Nan told me.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>“To let you in on the ground floor of the story
at once, a burglar got into the house up the river,
a few nights ago. Nan surprised the burglar at work,
made him give up his booty, agreed to say nothing about
it to the members of the household, and let him go.
But, it appears, that instead of relinquishing his booty
and going away empty handed, he only gave up what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
was in sight, and actually got away with a diamond
necklace and some other jewels that belonged to Mrs.
Remsen, and to some of her guests. Nan says that
what was actually stolen represented close to forty
thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Jimmy always was discriminating, when it came to
a selection of jewels,” said Chick, with a slow smile.</p>

<p>“Right again. But because of the disappearance of
those jewels, Nan finds herself in a perplexity. Now,
I’ll tell you the story just as it is.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“It happened last Thursday night. Nan had not been
feeling up to the mark that day. She had kept herself
rather to herself, since morning. During the day
Mrs. Remsen told Nan that she was expecting another
guest that evening—a gentleman from the South,
named Dinwiddie; Ledger Dinwiddie, to be exact.”</p>

<p>“Rather a high-sounding title, that; eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Well, Nan didn’t go down to dinner that
evening, so she did not meet the guest, when he arrived.
She retired early—that is, she arranged herself
in comfortable attire, and kept to her own room,
where she passed the time in reading. About eleven
o’clock, she tried to compose herself to sleep, but after
an hour of vain effort in that line, she decided that
it was of no use, and sought another book. There
did not happen to be one handy which interested her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and so, garbed in a wrapper, she descended the stairs
to the library.”</p>

<p>“It sounds like a chapter out of a book, Nick.”</p>

<p>“It does, for a fact; but you haven’t got the real
thing, yet.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, then.”</p>

<p>“She had bed slippers on her feet, which made no
sound as she walked. She crossed the lower hall, after
descending the stairs, and stepped into the library,
reaching around the jamb of the doorway, as she did so,
to switch on the electric lights—and she did it so
quickly that she failed to notice that there was a single
light already burning in the room.”</p>

<p>“More and more like a novel, Nick.”</p>

<p>“Yes. When she snapped on the lights, a man who
had been seated at the table in the middle of the room
sprang to his feet—and she found herself looking
into the muzzle of a revolver.”</p>

<p>“Well, it wasn’t the first time that Nan has done
that. It might have scared most women half to death;
but Nan——”</p>

<p>“I rather think that she was more surprised and
startled by the appearance of the man himself than by
the weapon he held in his hand,” said the detective,
interrupting. “The man was Jimmy Duryea; Bare-Faced
Jimmy; at least she says it was—and is.”</p>

<p>“And—<em>is</em>?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. I’m coming to that.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“The room was, of course, in a blaze of light. In
the man who confronted her, Nan saw the face and
features of Jimmy Duryea. On the table where he had
been seated was a confused heap of the spoil he had
stolen, and was engaged in sorting when Nan interrupted
him.”</p>

<p>“And she was looking into the muzzle of a gun,”
commented Chick.</p>

<p>“Yes. But it wasn’t that which startled her. It
was the face and appearance of the man; of a man
whom she supposed to have been dead four years, at
least; of the man whom she had once married, and
whom she had tenderly loved, until she discovered that
he was a crook, when she deserted him and got a
divorce.”</p>

<p>“What did she do?”</p>

<p>“What would nine out of ten women do, under
like circumstances?” retorted the detective.</p>

<p>“Let out a yell, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Nan cried out his name. ‘Jimmy!’ she exclaimed;
and he dropped the gun to the floor, and called back,
‘Nan!’”</p>

<p>“Tableau!” said Chick.</p>

<p>“Precisely,” said Nick Carter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.
<br />
<small>JIMMY DURYEA’S DARING.</small></h2>


<p>Chick chuckled softly to himself as he imagined the
scene in the library that Nick Carter had just described
to him.</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute, Nick,” he said. “Let me get
the chronology of those two straight in my mind.
Jimmy, according to his own story, told to us four
years ago, was, originally, a born aristocrat, the second
or third son of somebody-or-other, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He would never tell who he was; but it is
certain that he is well born.”</p>

<p>“So was Nan; and both were English, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Scapegrace Jimmy went to South Africa to finish
the sowing of his wild oats, and Nan went there as
governess to the children of the South African consul.
They met there, and were married. Jimmy was a
burglar and a thief, and Nan didn’t suspect it until
long after the two had come to this country. Then she
found it out, and for a time he compelled her to assist
him in his crooked work. Then he got caught, and was
sent away, to Sing Sing, and Nan got a divorce. Later,
she married Smathers, the man of many faces, and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
actor. Then Jimmy got out of prison, thought Nan
had peached on him, threatened vengeance, and all
that, and intended to kill her, until it happened that you
showed him that Nan was not the one who had betrayed
him. She wanted to reform, and did so, and Jimmy
agreed to let her alone. Then Jimmy got caught, was
sent back to England to answer charges against him
there, escaped, returned here, and supposedly died on
an island in Long Island Sound. That was four
years ago. Almost two years ago, Smathers died—I
suppose he is really dead, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, there is no doubt of that, Chick.”</p>

<p>“And now Nan discovers her former husband, robbing
a house where she is a respected guest, and——”</p>

<p>“And that isn’t all of it; not by a long shot.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, then.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was a tableau for a moment, after the mutual
discovery in that library. There was a half mask
on the table, which Jimmy had removed while he was
sorting the spoil. He always was a cool proposition,
you remember.”</p>

<p>“Yes. That is how he got his name of Bare-Faced
Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t lose his presence of mind, just then,
either. He stooped and picked up the gun from the
floor, dropped it into one of his pockets—and sat down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
again upon the chair where he had been seated when
she interrupted him.”</p>

<p>“Just like him.”</p>

<p>“The rest of the story I will tell just as Nan told it
to me.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“She said: ‘For a moment I didn’t know what to
do. Until that instant it had never occurred to me that
Jimmy was alive. I had not a doubt that he was dead.
But there he was, as natural as ever, as handsome as
ever, as cool and self-contained as ever, and just as
daring as he used to be in the old days.’</p>

<p>“‘Sit down, Nan,’ he said to her; and she sat down.</p>

<p>“‘I thought you were dead,’ she told him, and he
laughed in his pleasant way, and replied that he was as
good as an army of dead men. Then she pointed at
the jewels on the table, and at the other things that
he had gotten together.</p>

<p>“‘At your old tricks?’ she asked him, and he nodded.</p>

<p>“‘Can’t keep away from it, Nan,’ he told her. ‘It is
in my blood, I guess. But what are you doing here?
Are you up to the old game, too?’</p>

<p>“Then she told him all about herself, and they talked
together for quite a while. The upshot of it was that
Jimmy agreed to take the risk of returning all the
things to the rooms from which he had taken them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and she promised to wait where she was, until he had
done so.”</p>

<p>“That was like Jimmy. Think of the nerve of the
fellow, in going back to the rooms he had robbed, to
return the jewels to the places where he had found
them.”</p>

<p>“That is just the point, Chick; he didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Oh; I see.”</p>

<p>“He replaced a few of the things, but many of them
he still kept. He told her, when he came back, that
he had returned them, and it wasn’t till the following
day that she discovered his deception.”</p>

<p>“I think it is rather remarkable that she trusted him
to do it at all.”</p>

<p>“Jimmy could always make Nan believe that the
moon was made of green cheese. Well, she promised
him that she would say nothing of having found a man
in the library, and much less would she mention to any
living person who that man really was. So they parted.
Nan returned to her room, and retired. Jimmy, presumably,
left the house by the way he had entered it.”</p>

<p>“But he didn’t do that, either, eh?”</p>

<p>“No. He didn’t do that, either.”</p>

<p>“What did he do?”</p>

<p>“He sat opposite Nan, at the breakfast table, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
following morning, and was introduced to her by their
hostess as Mr. Ledger Dinwiddie.”</p>

<p>“Gee!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I said.”</p>

<p>“Say, Nick, if I had heard this story without names
being mentioned, I’d have said that Jimmy Duryea
would have done that very thing if he were alive.”</p>

<p>“So would I.”</p>

<p>“What did Nan do, when the introduction took
place?”</p>

<p>“What could she do? Nothing more than acknowledge
the introduction. She couldn’t tell the story of
what had happened during the night, with much more
credit to herself, than he could have done so; and,
besides, just then she supposed that all the stolen
property had been returned. It wasn’t till later in the
day—some time in the afternoon—that she knew the
truth.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“Then she laid for Jimmy. But he knew that, and
avoided her, of course. Finally, she went directly to
him, and asked him to walk with her to the stables,
and he couldn’t very well refuse to do that. Halfway
to the stables, they found a secluded spot, and there
she stopped him and told him that unless he returned
all the stolen property before the following morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
she would denounce him, no matter what might happen
to her.”</p>

<p>“And he made another promise, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“And kept it in about the same manner?”</p>

<p>“In precisely the same manner.”</p>

<p>“That brings the time to Saturday morning, doesn’t
it? The thing happened Thursday night.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“Saturday, she went for him again. He told her
that there had been no opportunity to replace the
stolen jewels the preceding night, but that he would
do it that night—Saturday night. Yesterday morning
she did not see him at all, but she learned that the
jewels had not been returned. Mrs. Remsen asked her
to take a motor ride, and she had to go. They came
to the city, and decided to remain till to-day—and
that is how Nan happened to be at church last night,
when I met her.”</p>

<p>“She was alone last night? Mrs. Remsen wasn’t
with her?”</p>

<p>“No; she was alone. Nan had been chewing on
the thing all day. She didn’t know what to do. She
said that she had decided to telephone to me, after
church, when she discovered that I was among the
members of the congregation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“In the meantime I suppose she hasn’t said a word
to anybody but you.”</p>

<p>“Not a word.”</p>

<p>“What have you advised her to do?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t advised her—yet. What I did do was to
promise to become one of the invited guests at ‘The
Birches,’ as they call the Remsen place on the Hudson.”</p>

<p>“I see. So you are going up there, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“In a couple of hours. I’m going to take the car,
and drive there—and you are going with me. Danny
will do the driving.”</p>

<p>“Oho! I see! Do you know the Remsens?”</p>

<p>“No. I never met either of them; or any of the
family; but Nan said she could fix that part of it
all right. Nan was to tell Mrs. Remsen, this morning,
that she met an old friend at church, who is to motor
out their way to-day, and that she invited him to stop
at The Birches. That is all there is to that.”</p>

<p>“You intend to get Jimmy off to one side, and—what?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t decided that point, as yet. You see, there
is another complication in the affair. Mrs. Remsen
is Theodore Remsen’s second wife. There are two
stepchildren at The Birches, a son and a daughter—and
Ledger Dinwiddie is supposed to be the future husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of Lenore Remsen. You see, Jimmy Duryea has
an assured position at the house, and in the family.
He thinks, now, that Nan dare not denounce him, because
of the effect that such a denouncement would
have upon herself; but with me on the ground——”</p>

<p>“I see. What do you propose to do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Chick, until I get on the ground. It
is a queer case all around. Nan is for compelling
Jimmy to give up the plunder, and to disappear, without
doing anything to him at all. She believes that I am
the only person who can accomplish that with him—and,
under the circumstances, she is about right, Chick.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“So I promised her that I would go there this afternoon.
She and Mrs. Remsen—who is a beautiful
woman of about Nan’s age—were to return this morning;
they are probably halfway there by this time.”</p>

<p>“And you want me with you.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes. I thought you’d like it. Jimmy will
realize what he is up against when he sees both of us
there.”</p>

<p>“He certainly ought to.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know just what attitude Jimmy will take.
You know as well as I do that he never plans a thing
of this sort without doing it thoroughly. He is doubtless
prepared at every turn, and he may have the bareface
to defy me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“It wouldn’t surprise me if he did.”</p>

<p>“Nor me, either, Chick.”</p>

<p>“Then what?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we won’t cross any bridges till we get to
them.”</p>

<p>“How soon will we start, Nick?”</p>

<p>“In an hour or two.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.
<br />
<small>THROWING THE GAUNTLET.</small></h2>


<p>“The Birches,” one of the summer residences of
Theodore Remsen, multimillionaire, financier, Wall
Street wizard, and one of the recognized powers in
the moneyed world, stood, and still stands, a prominent
landmark at the location already described.</p>

<p>It stands upon a high bluff overlooking the Hudson,
and is approached from the main highway by a winding,
macadamized road, which, from the lodge gate to
the mansion, is more than a mile in length, and shaded
on either side by a double row of white birches;
hence its name.</p>

<p>The lawn, directly in front of the house, is laid
out in tennis courts, and there Nick Carter and Chick
discovered nearly all the guests of the house assembled,
when they drove beneath the porte-cochère at four
o’clock that Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>Nancy Nightingale had evidently been watching for
their arrival, for as Nick stepped down from the car
and gave Danny a few directions, he saw her approaching.
He went forward to meet her, followed by Chick.</p>

<p>As the detective moved toward her he cast his eyes
rapidly over the assembled people—there was a score<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of them, all told—and thought he saw Jimmy Duryea
among them, engaged in an animated conversation with
a group of which he appeared to be the centre. But
the man’s back was turned, and Nick could not be
certain.</p>

<p>Nan, in an outing gown and coat of white flannel,
with her black hair and sparkling eyes, looked more
beautiful than ever as she approached the two detectives,
and her smile of greeting was warmth itself.</p>

<p>She conducted them directly toward the place where
Mrs. Remsen was seated, and presented them. She
added, after she had done so:</p>

<p>“I told Mrs. Remsen that I had invited you to stop
here to call upon us, and now she insists that you shall
join our party for as long a time as you can remain.”</p>

<p>After that, with Nan on his arm, Nick passed from
group to group on the lawn, acknowledging introductions
here and there as he went along. Chick remained
with the group that had formed around the hostess.</p>

<p>Presently Nick and his companion approached that
particular group of which the man who called himself
Ledger Dinwiddie, and whom Nan believed to be
Jimmy Duryea, formed one part.</p>

<p>Nan purposely left the introduction to him, for the
last of that particular group; and then she said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Dinwiddie, this is an old friend of mine—Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Carter;” and Duryea turned about lazily, as if he had
not noticed the arrival of a stranger till that moment.</p>

<p>“Glad to know you, Mr. Carter,” he said imperturbably,
and with just the faintest trace of a smile on his
handsome features; and then he turned back again
to the companion with whom he had been talking,
and who happened to be the daughter of the house,
Miss Lenore Remsen, who was not more than two
years younger than her beautiful stepmother.</p>

<p>There was not the slightest trace of recognition in
the eyes of Jimmy Duryea when he acknowledged that
introduction, although he must have known Nick Carter
at once—and he could not have prepared for the
sudden appearance of the detective there, unless he
had guessed that Nan might communicate with the detective
while she was in the city.</p>

<p>Nick was equally reticent. It was no part of his
present purpose to force matters; at least he did not
intend to do so until the proper moment should arrive;
but he did desire to get the gentleman cracksman
into conversation, to see how far the assurance of the
man would carry him.</p>

<p>Presently he found an opportunity.</p>

<p>It was when Duryea turned to make some general
remark to those near him, and Nick chose to reply directly
to it.</p>

<p>“I quite agree with you, Mr. Dinwiddie,” he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
“Stolen jewels are difficult things to trace. That is
the subject you were discussing, I believe?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Nan, before Duryea could reply. “A
most remarkable thing happened here, during the night
of last Thursday. A necklace, and other jewels, disappeared
most mysteriously from the rooms of the
owners. But—shhh—we have all agreed to keep very
still about it, for the present.”</p>

<p>Duryea laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, Miss Nightingale,” he said, “this gentleman
will be able to make some valuable suggestions
in regard to those missing jewels. He has a namesake
in New York who is said to be one of the smartest of
living detectives. Isn’t that so, Carter? Eh?”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” replied Nick, looking him directly in
the eye. “Only the gentleman to whom you refer is
not a namesake. I happen to be the person mentioned
myself.”</p>

<p>Duryea’s brows went upward in well-feigned surprise;
a chorus of exclamations arose from every side;
Nan bit her lips, for she had not intended that Nick
should announce himself quite in that manner.</p>

<p>Lenore Remsen turned at once to the detective, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Carter, are you the detective?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Remsen, I really am.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad. Then you can assist us to recover
our jewels.”</p>

<p>“I can try, if it is your wish that I should do so,”
replied Nick calmly. “Were you a victim of the robberies,
Miss Remsen?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. It was my diamond necklace that was
the most valuable thing taken. I must admit that I was
very careless about it that night. Instead of putting
it away, as usual, I merely dropped it into my jewel
box. In the morning it was gone. Don’t you think,
Mr. Carter, that it is remarkable how a burglar could
get into the house, and go through the rooms as that
one did, without leaving a trace of any sort behind
him?”</p>

<p>“It does seem so; yes.”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t a trace. Not one; anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Was no one in the house suspected?” asked Nick
quietly.</p>

<p>“No one in the——Oh, you mean one of the servants,
of course. No; really. The staff of servants that we
have in this house are, all of them, old retainers; every
one of them has been a long time with us. You know
this is the one place which we really call home. We
always speak of ‘coming home,’ when we come here.
Oh, no, indeed, we could not suspect one of the servants.”</p>

<p>“What is your opinion on the subject, Mr. Dinwiddie?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
asked the detective, turning fairly toward
Duryea.</p>

<p>The latter smiled, showing his white and even teeth;
he twirled his mustache for a moment before he replied,
and when he did so it was with deliberation.</p>

<p>“Really,” he said, “you know I am not an authority,
Mr. Carter—such as yourself, for example. Still—er—I
think I have an opinion, nevertheless. We are
all apt to form opinions in such cases, don’t you think,
Mr. Carter?”</p>

<p>“Yes. What is yours? You interest me.”</p>

<p>“Do I? Really! You confess yourself to be the
great and only Nick Carter, and then do me the honor
to care for my opinion!”</p>

<p>“In the hope that it might prove to be an expert one—yes,”
replied the detective.</p>

<p>“Expert? Oh, dear, no; not at all expert. Just an
opinion.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p>“I shall shock all the ladies present—and some who
are not immediately present in this group—when I
mention it.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless——”</p>

<p>“Oh, nevertheless, I shall not hesitate—even at the
risk of giving offense. I should venture it as my opinion
that the thief in this instance is a woman, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
she happens to be a servant—or one of the guests.
There! Have I shocked all of you?”</p>

<p>He laughed easily when he asked the question, as if
to take away the sting of it, and he turned his speaking
eyes from one to another of the group until he had
gone the rounds—and, somehow, he managed to create
the impression that he was merely indulging in a joke
at their expense.</p>

<p>But there was an uneasy laugh around him, nevertheless.</p>

<p>Lenore Remsen started to her feet, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I think that was horrid of you, Ledger! Horrid!
The idea of saying such a thing! We shall all be looking
askance at each other, from now on. What do you
think about it, Miss Nightingale?”</p>

<p>“I should sooner incline to the opinion that the
thief was a man, and a guest,” was the deliberate reply;
and she added, not without intent, for she was
angry, seeing exactly what Duryea had intended to
convey to her: “One of the lately arrived guests, at
that.”</p>

<p>Lenore clapped her hands.</p>

<p>“That is where you get it back, Ledger,” she exclaimed.
“But, really, that was horrid of you, to say
such a thing.”</p>

<p>“Who are the lately arrived guests, Miss Nightingale?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
asked the detective, without turning his head;
and she replied, without hesitation:</p>

<p>“Mr. Dinwiddie is himself the most lately arrived
one.”</p>

<p>Duryea laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“Good!” he said. “That is right, too. I arrived
that very evening. Now, I wonder if it could have
been me? I used to walk in my sleep when I was a
child, although I don’t remember that I had the habit
of purloining necklaces when I did so. But, then, one
never can tell.”</p>

<p>“Indeed one cannot,” retorted Nan. And then, assuming
the air of one who was joking, she added: “I
should advise a close inspection into your past record,
Mr. Dinwiddie, if it is true that you formerly were in
the habit of prowling about houses in the night.”</p>

<p>“Gladly!” he exclaimed, joining in the general laugh
that followed. “Will you give us the benefit of searching
yours, also, Miss Nightingale?”</p>

<p>A slow flush stole into the cheeks and brow of Nan
Nightingale, but she was equal to the occasion. She
replied:</p>

<p>“It will not be necessary that you should search.
Fortunately there is one who has known me many
years. Mr. Carter can supply all particulars that may
be required.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” said Duryea, “that what was intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
as a joke all around has taken a serious turn.
Let us drop it before we begin to indulge in personalities.
Nevertheless, Miss Nightingale, it is well to
have a person so renowned as Nick Carter to vouch
for one. I only wish that he could perform the same
service for me.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, Mr. Dinwiddie, I might be able to do
that, also,” replied Nick quietly. “It is my profession
to know something about a great many people who
do not suppose that I know them at all. However,
as you say, the conversation is taking too serious a
turn. I will propose a game of tennis with you, Mr.
Dinwiddie; what do you say?”</p>

<p>“Gladly. Come along. Singles?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Singles. There is a vacant court.”</p>

<p>“All right. You’re on. But I warn you, Mr.
Carter, I am considered an expert.”</p>

<p>“So much the better. I think I just suggested
that about you in quite another line, did I not?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.
<br />
<small>THE GHOST OF JIMMY.</small></h2>


<p>The game of tennis was over.</p>

<p>There were indications of a shower, and the spectators
had scampered toward the wide verandas for
shelter, so that Nick Carter and the so-called Ledger
Dinwiddie stood alone near one end of the net. It
was the opportunity which Nick wanted.</p>

<p>“Well, Jimmy, this is a bolder game than usual,
that you are playing, isn’t it?” he asked smilingly.</p>

<p>Duryea raised his eyes to the detective’s without
a trace of resentment in them, and also without a vestige
of surprise visible. He also raised his brows interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Now, I wonder where in the world you hit upon
that name?” he said, in reply, and his expression denoted
nothing more nor less than wonderment. “That
is what my dear old dad used to call me, Jimmy! James
Ledger Dinwiddie is my full name. How’d you hit
upon the Jimmy part of it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, Jimmy, don’t try to play it out with
me. You know it won’t work. You are Jimmy
Duryea, all right—and the climate of The Birches isn’t
good for you, just now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“What the blazes do you mean?” was the indignant
ejaculation; and then: “I say, we’ll get caught in that
shower, old chap. Come along!”</p>

<p>He seized his racket from the ground and started
toward the house; but he had not taken two steps before
Nick Carter seized him by the arm and propelled
him toward a summerhouse that was near at hand.</p>

<p>“This place will shelter us, Jimmy,” he said coldly.
“You come along with me. If you attempt to resist,
I shall take you there anyhow, so if you don’t want a
scene here on the lawn, come.”</p>

<p>“This is a high-handed——” began Duryea; but the
detective interrupted him.</p>

<p>“It’ll be higher-handed if you don’t do as I say,”
he remarked; and then the big, advance raindrops began
to fall, and they ran together beneath the shelter
of the summerhouse.</p>

<p>“Now, what the deuce——”</p>

<p>“Drop it, Jimmy. If you don’t, I’ll put the handcuffs
on you now, and take you away with me through
this storm. You know that I can do it.”</p>

<p>Bare-Faced Jimmy shrugged his shoulders. Then
he laughed. He dropped his lithe and graceful length
upon one of the rustic settees, thrust his hands deeply
into his pockets, and replied:</p>

<p>“Well, speak your piece, Mr. Carter, since you seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
bound to do so. I can listen, and the storm prevents
my leaving you. Besides, there is no one to hear us.”</p>

<p>“No; there isn’t any one to overhear us. That is
why I pulled you into this place.”</p>

<p>“Extremely kind and thoughtful of you, I’m sure;
only, you’d have done better if you had not ventured
to thrust yourself upon me at all, wouldn’t you? What
the blazes is the matter with you, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Drop it, I say, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“Gladly—if you’ll tell me what it is that you want
me to drop,” was the cool reply. He removed his hands
from his pockets long enough to abstract a cigarette
case from another one, and to light a cigarette. “Have
one? No? Too bad. They’re Russian.”</p>

<p>“Drop the play acting with me, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“Say, look here, mister man, it was all right for you
to make a play with that name that my dad used to
call me—at first; but it’s getting tiresome,” exclaimed
Duryea, with a fine show of rancour. “I’m Jimmy, all
right, only nobody calls me by that name now. I’m
Mr. Dinwiddie, particularly to strangers, if you don’t
mind. I’ll thank you to address me by that name.
What kind of a game are you up to, anyway? Blackmail?”</p>

<p>The effrontery of the man was phenomenal.</p>

<p>Instead of being offended by it, Nick Carter was
amused; and he could not resist a small sense of admiration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
too, for Duryea’s pluck, under the circumstances.
He resolved to meet him on the ground he
had selected.</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Dinwiddie,” he said, smiling. “It
is my wish to discuss a certain person whom we both
knew in the past. If you prefer to speak of that person
in the third person, I see no reason for not humoring
you. But, before we continue with the subject, I
wish to warn you that I am about through with your
pose. I will talk in the third person about that other
man, but you’ve got to talk—or something will happen.”</p>

<p>“How melodramatic. Look here, Carter, what are
you driving at?”</p>

<p>“I’m driving at one Bare-Faced Jimmy Duryea.”</p>

<p>“Oh; you are! And who might he be? Or who
might he have been? Is he a dead one, or is he alive,
Mr. Carter? You interest me. Really, you do.”</p>

<p>“He has long since been supposed to be dead, but
just now he seems to be very much alive.”</p>

<p>“That’s where you are dead wrong, Carter. Believe
me, you are. Dead men do not return. Neither
do they discuss tales of themselves. Bare-Faced Jimmy,
eh? What a name!”</p>

<p>“It was never more appropriate than at this moment,
Jimmy, for if you are not the most barefaced reprobate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
out of prison, I’ll eat my hat; and that’s quite
a compliment.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. Anyway, I choose to take it so, rather
than be offended. But you said he was supposed to
be dead—this Bare-Faced Jimmy, as you call him. Why
not let him lie? What is the use of stirring up the
dead?”</p>

<p>“He has been stealing jewels, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Oh; has he?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He can stay dead just as long as he pleases
if he returns those jewels, and then disappears again,
at once.”</p>

<p>“I see. It must be his ghost that you are talking
about, Carter.”</p>

<p>“Yes; we’ll call it that. The ghost of Bare-Faced
Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“What has he got to do besides return the jewels he
has stolen?”</p>

<p>“Beat it. Skip. Get out. Disappear.”</p>

<p>“What! All four, and all at once? Really. Say!
Suppose the ghost refuses to walk?”</p>

<p>“He won’t refuse when he realizes just what he is
up against.”</p>

<p>“Won’t he? Maybe you wrong him there. Perhaps
you do not do this ghost full justice.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not; but I think I do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, Carter, honest, did you ever hear of a ghost
that got caught? A real ghost?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I ever did.”</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t hear of this one’s getting caught,
either. If the ghost of Jimmy Duryea stole the jewels
you are talking about, the ghost of Jimmy Duryea
intends to keep them, and it will go hard with the man
or woman—or shall I say the man and woman—who
attempts to deprive the ghost of them.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter’s reply was a smile.</p>

<p>“There aren’t any witnesses to this conversation,
Carter,” Duryea went on, “so I don’t mind being more
or less plain with you for just a moment.”</p>

<p>“I am glad that you have arrived at that conclusion,
Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you this: If anybody has got to ‘drop it,’
as you suggested just now, you are the one to do it.
You have bitten off more than you can chew. You
just now said that Mr. James Duryea is dead. Let him
lie. Mr. Ledger Dinwiddie stands before you, and Mr.
Ledger Dinwiddie can prove his descent for generations
back, and that without the slightest trouble. If
Jimmy Duryea’s ghost walks, Nick Carter won’t be
the man to lay it. You can bet your last dollar on
that.”</p>

<p>“All the same, I think he will; and to prove it to
you, I’ll just clap the irons upon you right now, Jimmy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and as soon as this storm is past I’ll take you where you
belong.”</p>

<p>As the detective spoke he produced a pair of handcuffs
from one of his pockets, and he held them, jingling
before Duryea’s eyes, looking straight at the man.</p>

<p>But Duryea only laughed.</p>

<p>“Put ’em away, Carter,” he said. “You won’t use
them; not on me; not to-day, at least.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because you won’t. That’s reason enough. What
do you think would happen, if you should be ass
enough to do what you threaten?”</p>

<p>“I think it would be Sing Sing for yours, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“Not on your life; not much.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll admit, for the sake of argument, that you
may have enough against the aforesaid James Duryea
to send him up for the rest of his life; but—you know
the old receipt for roasting a hare, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“First catch your hare, Carter. In this case, first
catch the man—or shall I say the ghost?”</p>

<p>“Say what you please; it does not alter the circumstance.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it? You would find that it did. Admitting
that the ghost of Jimmy Duryea is now standing before
you, you have already agreed that a ghost was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
never caught. Do you suppose—you who claim to
know me—that I would be fool enough, if I were the
man you believe me to be, to stand here and defy you
unless I knew exactly what I was doing?”</p>

<p>“You’ve got cheek enough to do almost anything,
Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I have got brains enough to have prepared
for all the emergencies that might arise, too. I
asked you a moment ago if you realized what would
happen if you should clap those irons onto me and take
me away. You haven’t replied to that question, yet.”</p>

<p>“You answer it, then.”</p>

<p>“You would make a charge against me—as James
Duryea. I would establish the fact that I am not
James Duryea. All the pictures in the world, no matter
whether they are in a rogues’ gallery or not, would
have any effect upon the proof that I would be able
to offer. I have a long line of ancestry to fall back
upon. Ledger Dinwiddie is a personality, widely
known in a certain locality where his home is—now.
Jimmy Duryea is dead, and buried, and his bones can
be dug up, if necessary. Nick Carter, the great detective,
would make himself the laughingstock of the
whole country.”</p>

<p>“Nick Carter isn’t a bit afraid of doing that,
Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“And then, again, you heard my opinion—the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
I gave out there on the lawn—about the personality
of the thief who stole the jewels. I need only suggest
to you that if you should enter that house now,
and make a search, you might find the jewels, and
you might not; but if you did find them, you would
find that everything would point to the identity of the
thief as I named it out there.”</p>

<p>“You scoundrel! Do you mean to say——”</p>

<p>“I mean what I have said—no more, no less. You
cannot crush me, Carter; you haven’t got it in your
power to do so, just now. I would rise, like a phœnix
from the ashes, and laugh at you.”</p>

<p>“You think so.”</p>

<p>“No; I know so. I know exactly how thoroughly I
have builded this edifice in which I am now living.
And so, Mr. Nicholas Carter, the ghost of Bare-Faced
Jimmy defies you!”</p>

<p>He stopped and then laughed mockingly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.
<br />
<small>NICK MEETS DEFIANCE.</small></h2>


<p>It might occur to the reader to ask: Why did not
Nick Carter seize upon his man then and there, put
the irons on him, and take him away? The answer
is obvious.</p>

<p>The detective knew the man with whom he had to
deal, too well.</p>

<p>He realized that Jimmy Duryea would never have
placed himself in the present position unless he had
been very sure of his ground.</p>

<p>There was no doubt in Nick’s mind that when Jimmy
found that Nan had gone to the city, he suspected at
once that she would notify Nick Carter of all that had
happened at The Birches. The fact that Jimmy had
awaited with calmness the arrival of the detective upon
the scene was sufficient proof that the former burglar
was fairly positive of the ground upon which he
stood.</p>

<p>Jimmy denied his identity while admitting it—by implication.</p>

<p>He called himself the ghost of Bare-Faced Jimmy
with an irony that was inimitable.</p>

<p>He had stated that Ledger Dinwiddie, the man whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
he claimed to be, could establish his identity, with a
long line of ancestry, without a doubt, and with very
little trouble; and he had asserted that the bones of
Jimmy Duryea might be dug up, if necessary, to prove
that Jimmy Duryea was really dead.</p>

<p>There is just where the rub came. Jimmy might be
bluffing, but again he might be entirely in earnest.
Jimmy was a careful one in preparing his coups, and
there could be no doubt that he had prepared this one
from every available standpoint.</p>

<p>And again, until that meeting with Nan, at the
church, Nick Carter himself had believed that Duryea
was long since dead and buried.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Nick Carter was not one to be driven
aside from a determination upon which he had studied
and decided; and he had decided that this was Jimmy
Duryea, and that he must not only give up the stolen
property, but must also disappear. If the detective
at times appeared to hesitate, it was only because he
wished to make himself more sure of his own ground.</p>

<p>“Jimmy,” he said, after a short pause which followed
the burglar’s last remark, which was in the nature
of a defiance, “you can’t bluff me, and you know
you can’t.”</p>

<p>“That is precisely why I am not attempting to do so,”
was the quick retort. “You will find, if you persevere
far enough, that this is no bluff. I’m in dead earnest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Jimmy Duryea is dead, buried, and gone; Ledger Dinwiddie
is very much alive, and is here on the spot,
ready to do business. Ledger Dinwiddie owns estates
in the South, heavily mortgaged, to be sure; but
his, nevertheless. He can prove who he is, and every
statement he makes about himself. If you should place
me under arrest, you would cause me great inconvenience,
to be sure; but you would cause others more
than you would me—yourself among the number.
Now, you can take that, or leave it.”</p>

<p>“You are covertly making a threat against Nan
Nightingale.”</p>

<p>“I am not covertly threatening anybody; but I openly
threaten every person, no matter who it is, who attempts
to connect me with the former Jimmy Duryea. Now
you’ve got it, straight from the shoulder.”</p>

<p>“Jimmy, I’ve got three questions to ask you.”</p>

<p>“Fire away.”</p>

<p>“I won’t go into the details of them till I have
asked all of them.”</p>

<p>“Just as you please. I don’t want to hurry you. The
storm is almost over, and as soon as it is past I shall
deny myself the pleasure of your company, and go to
the house.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that—when the storm is over.”</p>

<p>“We will see. Now, what are your questions?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“The first one is this: Will you return those jewels
you stole last Thursday night?”</p>

<p>“I have not stolen any jewels, and therefore I cannot
return any. Next?”</p>

<p>“Will you, after the jewels are returned to the
proper owners, leave this place, and the United States
as well, never to return, on condition that I let you
go away unmolested?”</p>

<p>“Since I cannot—or will not, if you prefer it so—return
the jewels, that last question requires no answer;
but I will answer it by saying that I shall remain
a guest at this place just so long as it pleases me to
do so.”</p>

<p>“The third and last question, is this: Will you
promise me never to communicate with Lenore Remsen
again, after to-day?”</p>

<p>One quick flash of keen resentment crossed the face
of Duryea, when that question was asked; but it was
gone as quickly as it appeared. He laughed outright,
flicking away the stub of a cigarette as he did so, and
producing another one.</p>

<p>“Don’t be an ass, Carter,” he said, rising and turning
to cross the summerhouse toward the door through
which they could see the people on the veranda of the
mansion.</p>

<p>Instantly Nick Carter leaped from the seat he had
been occupying, and sprang upon him. He seized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
him by the arms, pulled his hands behind him, and
snapped the handcuffs upon his wrists in that position;
and then Nick pulled him away from the door so that
there was no chance of being seen from the house.</p>

<p>Beyond the first impulse of resistance, Jimmy made
none at all; and when the detective thrust him back
again upon the chair where he had been seated before,
he looked up with a quiet smile, as if he rather enjoyed
the proceeding.</p>

<p>“Jimmy,” said Nick, “I’m not going to monkey with
you. You are past all that. You have laid your plans,
and you think they will work out to the end. But they
won’t. They might do so with some people, but they
won’t with me. Now, I offer you your liberty upon
those three conditions, and I do it for Nan’s sake, not
for yours.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you marry her, Carter?” was the cool
response. “You’re a widower, and she is twice a
widow. Why don’t you marry her? You seem to be
mightily stuck on her.”</p>

<p>“I am, in the sense that I thoroughly respect a
good woman, Jimmy, and Nan is that.”</p>

<p>“She was good enough to go to you and give things
away up here, when she supposed that she had the
kibosh on me,” sneered Jimmy.</p>

<p>“She did not come to me and give you away,
Jimmy. I met her by accident; and even then it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
after you had broken your solemn word given to her
that night. What has changed you so, Jimmy? You
used to be a man of your word, even though you were
a crook.”</p>

<p>“I’m not Jimmy, I tell you. Jimmy is dead. Nothing
of him remains—unless it is that ghost we have
been talking about. Come, Carter, take these irons off
me. You can only make trouble for Nan, if I am
found in this predicament. She would be the one to
suffer; not I.”</p>

<p>“You think so.”</p>

<p>“I know so, Carter. I know whereof I speak. I
don’t do things halfway, and you know I do not. I
intend to carry off this plan I have laid out, Nick Carter
to the contrary, notwithstanding.”</p>

<p>“What does that plan include, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“If I should tell you, you would know.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you would have married that
girl, if fortune had not gone against you in the way
it has?”</p>

<p>“I intend to marry her, as it is. I have got a name
to perpetuate, Carter; the name of Dinwiddie. There
is not an older or a better one in this benighted country
of yours.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will tell me how you came by that
name,” suggested the detective; and he was surprised
when Duryea laughed aloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’d like to tell you; by Jove, I would, and no mistake,
Carter. It is almost too good to keep. But that
would be throwing altogether too much information in
your way—and it cannot be done. Look here, Carter,
I’ll tell you what I’ll do.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>This was what Nick had been hoping for. He had
now got his man to a point where he was tacitly admitting
his position, and was doing his share of the
talking.</p>

<p>“We’ll admit, for the sake of the circumstance, that
I am the ghost of Bare-Faced Jimmy, or at least that
I represent the ghost. We’ll admit that the ghost got
the diamonds. We’ll admit that the ghost can return
them. See?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll confess to you that I badly need those
diamonds, in order to carry out my plans, for I am
short of money. Nevertheless, since you make such a
point of it, I’ll get the ghost to return them to their
proper owners—on a condition.”</p>

<p>“What is the condition?”</p>

<p>“Wait. Don’t go off half cocked.”</p>

<p>“What is the condition?”</p>

<p>“I’ll return the diamonds, I’ll forget, as long as I
live, that I ever saw Nan Nightingale in my life—provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
you’ll go away from here and forget that such
a person as Jimmy Duryea ever existed.”</p>

<p>For a moment the detective stared at Jimmy; then he
laughed shortly.</p>

<p>“Have you so small an opinion of me as that, Duryea?”
he asked. “Do you suppose that I would permit
a man like you to ruin the life of that girl, as you
would do, if she became your wife?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t ruin it; I would make her happy. I
would——”</p>

<p>“That’s enough of that. Do you know, I have more
than half a notion to call your bluff about your being
able to prove yourself to be a Dinwiddie, and take you
in right now?”</p>

<p>“Try it on, if you think it will work, Carter.”</p>

<p>Nick started to his feet as if he intended to do so.
He was more than half inclined to do it, and probably
might have done so, had it not been that at that moment
he heard voices, as if persons were approaching
the summerhouse.</p>

<p>He stepped quickly to the vine-shaded doorway, and
looked out.</p>

<p>The storm had passed, and halfway across the lawn
from the house, coming toward him, was Lenore Remsen,
accompanied by two of the young women guests at
the mansion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick realized instantly that this was no time for the
dénouement.</p>

<p>One glance, and the thought that accompanied it,
satisfied him that the time was not yet ripe, and he
wheeled and returned quickly to the side of Duryea.</p>

<p>Then, without a word, he quickly unlocked the manacles
and removed them, dropping them into a pocket
out of sight.</p>

<p>“Thanks. Thanks, awfully,” drawled Duryea, and
yawned. “You’re really quite a bore, Carter—sometimes.”</p>

<p>“People are coming, Jimmy,” said Nick, speaking
rapidly. “You are free, now, for the moment, but it
won’t be for long. I am not sparing you, just now;
I am sparing that poor girl, whom you are deceiving.
But I’ll tell you right now, Duryea, that from this
moment, no matter what happens, I do not leave your
trail until you are behind the bars of a prison, condemned
under the name that belongs to you. I’ll add
that the offer I made a little while ago, to let you escape
on conditions, is withdrawn. That’s all. You
have defied me, Duryea, and you will have to take the
consequences. Maybe you know what that means when
I say it. If you do not, there are people up at Sing
Sing who could tell you.”</p>

<p>The first tinge of uneasiness that Duryea had shown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
appeared in his face for an instant; and then the summerhouse
door was darkened by the young women
whom Nick had seen approaching, and he started to his
feet with a smile and an exclamation of greeting. A
moment later they were all walking together toward
the mansion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.
<br />
<small>WHEN A MAN IS DESPERATE.</small></h2>


<p>During what remained of that day, through the dinner
hour, and in the evening when the entire company
of guests thronged the big rooms, Nick Carter and
Duryea kept as far apart as they conveniently could.
Nick had an object in carrying out his part of that
unspoken arrangement: He wished Jimmy to understand
that he had not yet decided what to do.</p>

<p>It has always been one of the detective’s theories that
if you leave a criminal well enough alone, he will
presently become uneasy under the restraint of inaction,
and do something himself. Nick had a notion
that Jimmy would attempt some sort of move before
another day came around, if only he were left severely
to himself; that is, as far as the detective was concerned.</p>

<p>But Nick found an opportunity to make Chick thoroughly
acquainted with all that had happened; and he
also had it arranged to take Nan in to dinner, and so
secured an opportunity to talk with her.</p>

<p>He noticed, while at the dinner table, that Jimmy,
who was seated nearly opposite, kept a furtive eye upon
him and Nan, and noted that they were whispering together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
No doubt the cracksman would think that
they were hatching some sort of a plot against him.
That was precisely what Nick wished to have him
think.</p>

<p>Nick did not believe that Jimmy would have the pluck
to hold his ground, and really attempt to marry the
girl; for he must know that Nick Carter would never
permit that.</p>

<p>No, it was plain to the detective that the bluff on
Jimmy’s part was directed at some other effort, since
that one must now be abandoned.</p>

<p>There was a time after dinner when Nick and Nan
found themselves alone together, at a corner of the
veranda. Nick was seated upon the rail, and Nan
stood beside him, picking apart the leaves of a wilted
rose that she held in her hand.</p>

<p>It was the first chance that Nick had had to tell
her about what happened in the summerhouse; there
had been no opportunity to do so at the dinner table.</p>

<p>“You and Jimmy were a long time in the summerhouse
together, during the storm,” she said to him,
in a low tone. “What happened?”</p>

<p>“A great deal happened, and very little happened,”
he replied, smiling.</p>

<p>“Tell me about it, Mr. Carter,” she asked.</p>

<p>“Jimmy is a great bluffer,” replied Nick. “He is
also a brave man, for one in his position. To tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the truth, Nan, if what he says is half the truth, he
holds trumps at the present moment. Can you guess
what he would do if I were to arrest him now?”</p>

<p>“Deny his identity, of course.”</p>

<p>“More than that. He has got another identity established.
That name he is wearing is more than a
mere name which he has assumed for his present
purposes.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that statement?”</p>

<p>“I mean that somehow he has managed to establish
a new identity. I don’t know how he has accomplished
it, but if I read him correctly, he has practically
made himself over into a new being, and established
beyond a doubt—that is, a present doubt—that
he is that person.”</p>

<p>“But how could he do that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know—at the present time; but some day
I shall make it my business to look into the matter;
after we have got the present predicament off our
hands.”</p>

<p>“You admit, then, that it is a predicament?”</p>

<p>“Decidedly so.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell me in just what way it is a predicament?”</p>

<p>“Jimmy has practically defied me. Out there in the
summerhouse I actually put the handcuffs on him,
thinking that he might weaken; but not a bit of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
He was as cool as a cucumber. He not only insisted that
he could prove the death of Jimmy Duryea, but that
he could prove his own identity as Ledger Dinwiddie.
He actually dared me to arrest him—and under the
circumstances I thought it best not to do so—till later.
Nan, where is the room you occupy in this house?”</p>

<p>“I have a suite of three rooms. They are in the
south wing. Why?”</p>

<p>“I want to go to them. I want to examine them—thoroughly.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I think that Jimmy has hidden those jewels
there.”</p>

<p>“What; in my rooms?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why should he do that?”</p>

<p>“Can’t you guess?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not. I——”</p>

<p>“When he found that you had gone to the city with
Mrs. Remsen, his first thought must have been one of
panic, for he guessed that you would go straight to
me with the story about him. The fact that he remained
here, was perfectly cool when I arrived, and
thoroughly the master of himself, is proof to anybody
who knows Jimmy that he had prepared to strike
back, and strike hard, if anything happened after your
return.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>She nodded, and Nick continued:</p>

<p>“When you returned, nothing happened; but there
is no doubt that he expected me, and was not in the
least surprised when I appeared on the scene. Do you
remember what he said when we were discussing the
theft of the jewels?”</p>

<p>“Yes. About a woman having taken them? He
meant me, did he not?”</p>

<p>“Surely. I understood it at the time, but he made
it more plain, later on, in the summerhouse. He almost
openly threatened you, in case anything happened
to him.”</p>

<p>“With a revelation of my past, do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Worse than that. With accusing you directly with
stealing the jewels, and proving it.”</p>

<p>“By finding them in my possession? Do you mean
that?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That is why you would like to search my rooms?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do you really think that he would have taken the
risk of hiding them in my rooms?”</p>

<p>“Nan, Jimmy Duryea will stop at nothing to carry
his point. He has come here, resolved to marry Theodore
Remsen’s daughter. He has made that daughter
fall in love with him, and he can render himself a
most lovable chap, if he has the mind to do so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is only too true, Mr. Carter. Even now I
find myself trying to make excuses for him. In the
old days, when he made me assist him in his burglaries,
and finally when I actually stole things under his direction,
there was no resisting him.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“But what——”</p>

<p>“Nan, Lenore Remsen will have a dowry of more
than a million. This house, with the estate upon which
it stands, will go to her. He regards that as a prize
worth winning, no matter what the effort. He stole the
jewels merely to provide himself with ready cash
when the time comes for him to leave here to prepare
for the wedding. The wedding itself is the great
goal.”</p>

<p>“I am aware of that.”</p>

<p>“Therefore, when he decided that you had gone to
New York to warn me, and possibly to bring me back
with you, he realized that he must make his position
unassailably strong, or else abandon it altogether.”</p>

<p>“But, how——”</p>

<p>“Now, if the worst should come to the worst, he
could tell what you used to be—and he knows that
you could not and would not deny that. He also knows
that you and I, both, will do anything in our power
to prevent the necessity of such a revelation.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“So it remains—at least it is apparent to me—that
he has found a place inside of your rooms to conceal
those stolen jewels; a place where he could find
them by accident, or where some other person would
find them seemingly by accident, in case a search should
be made for them. Where would you be then, Nan?”</p>

<p>She smiled wistfully; and then, with an attempt at
playfulness, replied:</p>

<p>“I’d be in a bad fix, wouldn’t I?”</p>

<p>“You certainly would.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Carter, he must know that he cannot
carry off that marriage, with you and I both at hand
to prevent it. He must know that we would not permit
it to take place, no matter what the consequences
might be.”</p>

<p>“One would think so; but—well, perhaps he intends,
somehow, to forestall us.”</p>

<p>“Forestall us? How could he do that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know; only, perhaps, if the marriage
had actually taken place, and there was no help for it,
you and I might both think that it would be the better
way to leave things alone. While we might, and
would, prevent such a thing, if we had the time and
the opportunity, we might both of us feel disinclined
to interfere after it had actually happened.”</p>

<p>“I understand what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Well, just what do you think I mean?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“That he was only playing you to gain time, and
that he will, if he can do it, induce Lenore to run away
with him, and be married. Only there wouldn’t be
any earthly reason for such a thing as that, when he is
already the accepted suitor. No; it isn’t that. It
is something else, and I think I can guess what it is.”</p>

<p>“What, then?”</p>

<p>“Remember, I have been his wife. I have lived with
him and I know him, even better than you do.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“A little while ago, you called him a brave man.
Well, if physical courage is bravery, then he can certainly
lay claim to that quality. James Duryea is not
afraid of anything.”</p>

<p>“I know it.”</p>

<p>“Once he has made up his mind to do a certain thing,
he will do that thing, though the heavens fall.”</p>

<p>“I understand that quality about him, too.”</p>

<p>“It is evident that he has made up his mind to marry
Lenore.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so.”</p>

<p>“And the only obstacles that are in his way at the
present moment stand right here; they are Nick Carter
and Nan Nightingale. Is that correct?”</p>

<p>“Admitted—if you put aside a small one that I see
at the other end of the veranda, who is called Chick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“True; I had forgotten Chick. But that does not
alter what I was about to say.”</p>

<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>“In the past, whenever obstacles got in the way of
Jimmy’s designs, he broke them down, put them aside,
or destroyed them. That is what he will attempt to do
now.”</p>

<p>“Nan, my dear girl, do you mean murder?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That is just what I do mean. He would not
hesitate.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, if there were opportunity. But here
there is none.”</p>

<p>“Then he will make one. I am afraid, Nick Carter!
I am afraid!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.
<br />
<small>PLOTTING AGAINST A PLOTTER.</small></h2>


<p>It should be permitted us to look inside the brain
of Bare-Faced Jimmy Duryea for a moment, in order
that we can see just how he was working out the existing
situation. It will help us better to understand
the events which followed; although, of course, the
one who reads must understand that no such privilege
could have been afforded the detective at that time.</p>

<p>He had to form his judgments as to what Jimmy
might determine to do next, from his past knowledge
of the man, and that, he decided wisely, was to his
credit.</p>

<p>We cannot relate here just how it happened that
Jimmy appeared at the summer residence of Theodore
Remsen in the character of a Southerner named
Ledger Dinwiddie, and was prepared to establish that
character, and the reputation that went with it, to all
comers. That is another story.</p>

<p>But that Jimmy Duryea never entered upon any
task without having thoroughly prepared himself to
meet all the emergencies that might arise has already
been made sufficiently clear.</p>

<p>His presence in that house as an accepted suitor for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the hand of Lenore Remsen was the result of careful
study and preparation, and the step had been taken
with due recognition of all the risks that had to be met
and overcome.</p>

<p>The encounter with Nan, in that house, and the manner
of it, as related by her to Nick Carter, were, of
course, unforeseen; they could not have been anticipated.</p>

<p>When Jimmy met Nan that night in the library,
while he was sorting over the jewels he had stolen, it
came in the nature of a surprise to him. He was absolutely
unprepared for it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he had met it with his customary
aplomb and coolness. We already know the consequences
of that encounter.</p>

<p>Jimmy had no intention of keeping his promise to
her, when he agreed to return the jewels to their rightful
owners; and that was because he really needed the
cash that the jewels would supply, rather than any
reluctance he felt to keeping his word with her.</p>

<p>In order to carry out his plans to the end, he did
really require more money, and a considerable amount
at that; else he would never have gone to the extent
of robbing the visitors at the house where he was himself
a guest; of actually robbing his expected bride of
her necklace.</p>

<p>But, so far as that was concerned, he merely argued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to himself that it was only anticipating the future.
That he was taking only what he had a right to take—or
would have a right to take later on.</p>

<p>But, when he did not keep his word, and Nan threatened
him with exposure, he came very near being desperate.</p>

<p>He had arrived at that position where this was the
last play out of the pack, so to speak. He had thrown
aside every other chance he had in his career, for
this one effort—to win a position in the world, a bride,
and a fortune, all at one cast.</p>

<p>Jimmy Duryea was never a murderer at heart; never
had he been cruelly inclined. He would go out of his
way to do a kindness to another, if it in no way interfered
with his own successes.</p>

<p>But that same characteristic worked to the opposite
extreme, as well.</p>

<p>Woe betide the circumstance or the person who
stood in the way of his success. He was thoroughly
implacable in that respect. So, when that Friday night
came, and he had not returned the jewels, and Nan
threatened him—and when, the following morning, he
discovered that Nan had gone to the city with Mrs.
Remsen, causing him to believe that she would seek
out Nick Carter and tell him all before her return—he
realized that he was “up against it hard,” and that
he was confronting the struggle of his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>And so, as Nick Carter had just told Nan, the coming
of the detective to the house that Monday afternoon
was no surprise to Jimmy Duryea. It was only a
confirmation of his expectation.</p>

<p>He had decided, long before Nick Carter appeared,
just how he would conduct himself when that incident
happened; and we have seen how he did it.</p>

<p>Naturally he could not foresee that interview in the
summerhouse; he was not entirely prepared for that;
but he met it, when it came, with all the cool effrontery
that was a part of him.</p>

<p>If Nick Carter knew and understood Jimmy Duryea,
no less did Jimmy Duryea know and understand
the detective.</p>

<p>At least he knew that Nick Carter could not be
bluffed.</p>

<p>Jimmy’s trump card was Nan—and Nan’s position
was precarious; and Jimmy knew that the detective
would stand for Nan, and protect her, just as far as it
was possible to do so.</p>

<p>But, after the interview in the summerhouse, Jimmy
was thoughtful. He knew that the truce that had
been declared when Nick took the irons off his wrists
was only a temporary arrangement, and that the detective
would lose no time in drawing the coils about
the interloper, and so tightly that there would be no
way of escape left open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Jimmy realized that in order to succeed now he
must play what remained of the game with supreme
boldness—and that he must rely upon his established
position in that house to see him through it to the end.</p>

<p>At dinner, as has been said, he watched his two
active enemies, covertly, all the time. He gave very
little thought to Chick, although he recognized the
fact that the assistant was there, prepared to render
aid whenever it should become necessary to do so.</p>

<p>After dinner, Jimmy kept his eyes open and his
wits on the alert, and he saw Nick and Nan when
they withdrew to one corner of the veranda, and entered
upon that intimate interview.</p>

<p>What Jimmy would have been willing to sacrifice
could he have overheard that conversation need not
be estimated upon; and the longer he watched it from
a distance, the more anxious he became concerning
what it might portend.</p>

<p>When he could stand it no longer, he drew Lenore
aside from the group with which she had mingled,
and with her on his arm sauntered toward Nick and
Nan, arriving at their secluded corner of the veranda
just at the moment when Nan had said to Nick:</p>

<p>“I am afraid, Nick Carter! I am afraid!”</p>

<p>Low as the words had been uttered, they were overheard.
Jimmy and Lenore both heard them, although
they understood them quite differently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Jimmy believed that he thoroughly comprehended
the meaning that was conveyed; Lenore was only puzzled
that Nan Nightingale should be afraid of anything,
and should give voice to her fears in exactly that
tone. As she stopped before them, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Afraid, Nan? Of what are you afraid?”</p>

<p>“Of the consequences of her misdeeds, doubtless,”
interjected Jimmy, before Nan could reply; and he
added, with deeper meaning than Lenore could understand:
“Fear is a wholesome thing, at times, when
it conveys a warning of things that are likely to happen,
under given conditions. It leads one to avoid
those conditions, eh, Mr. Carter?” and he laughed.</p>

<p>“Unless the fear is entirely misplaced, and unnecessary,
Mr. Dinwiddie,” replied the detective.</p>

<p>Nick looked across the veranda at that moment, and
managed to catch the eyes of Chick, to whom he signaled.
A moment later, Chick joined the little party
in the corner.</p>

<p>“I’m going to ask you to take my place here for
a time, Chick,” said the detective. “Mr. Dinwiddie has
begun a discourse on the quality of Fear, used as a
proper noun, and I will leave it to you to answer him.
Pray, do not let him escape, Chick, without having
first given a good reason for his last statement.”</p>

<p>The detective bowed, and withdrew. Nan laughed
aloud. Jimmy Duryea scowled. Lenore, unsuspecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the byplay that was contained in the sentence Nick
Carter had just uttered, smiled encouragingly upon
Chick.</p>

<p>But by those words Chick and Nan both understood
that they were to keep Jimmy Duryea under
surveillance for a time at least, while Nick Carter
should occupy himself elsewhere; but what was more
to the point, Jimmy understood them, also.</p>

<p>Nick Carter stepped aside, and passed into the house
through one of the open French windows; then he
disappeared.</p>

<p>He had been quite sincere when he had expressed a
desire to see the inside of the rooms that Nan occupied,
and he wished to see them at once. He believed that
no better opportunity could offer than the one already
at hand, and so he took advantage of it.</p>

<p>He had only a vague idea of the plan of the house,
judging it from the outside view he had been able to
obtain of the mansion when he approached it in the
automobile, and from the few words that Nan had
uttered regarding the location of her rooms.</p>

<p>He passed through the library, into the hall, and
up the wide stairway to the second floor, and so found
his way, with comparatively no difficulty, to Nan’s
suite of rooms.</p>

<p>The door was open, and he could see that there was
no one inside the room into which he peered; Nan’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
maid was evidently taking advantage of the evening
hour, to gossip with the other servants of the house.</p>

<p>The detective passed inside and closed the door after
him. Then he stopped, and began, from that point of
vantage immediately inside the closed door, to make a
systematic survey of his surroundings.</p>

<p>Nick Carter’s method under such circumstances has
been too often described to need repetition here. He
stood in that one spot on the floor, and permitted his
eyes to travel slowly from floor to ceiling, and back
again to floor, carefully covering every inch of space
that was before him, with that searching gaze.</p>

<p>There were just three points upon which Nick Carter
was certain since that conversation with Jimmy
Duryea in the summerhouse; two of them were dependent
upon the first one, but Jimmy had as good as
stated the first one for a fact.</p>

<p>First, then, Jimmy had hidden those stolen jewels
somewhere within the rooms occupied by Nan Nightingale—had
hidden them somewhere, so that when discovered,
apparently by accident or otherwise, the conclusion
would be self-evident that Nan had, herself,
hidden them there.</p>

<p>Second, they would necessarily have to be hidden
where searchers would come upon them more by accident
than by design.</p>

<p>Third, they could not, therefore, be under lock and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
key, put away in a drawer or a trunk; but must have
been placed in some receptacle into which a stranger
might peer, quite naturally, to discover them.</p>

<p>Although Nick Carter, during the half hour that
he spent inside those rooms, searched every possible
place where the jewels might have been hidden, he
turned at last toward the door, profitless from the
search.</p>

<p>He had peered into every vase, into every possible
receptacle that stood in sight, and had found no trace
of them—and so much time had elapsed that he did
not dare to remain longer away from the other members
of the house party.</p>

<p>So he turned toward the door which opened upon
the hall, opened it, and found himself looking into
the face of Jimmy Duryea.</p>

<p>But Jimmy did not come within reach. He only
laughed, and turned hastily away.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” he said. “I thought so;” and then he
ran down the stairs, before Nick could make an effort
to detain him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.
<br />
<small>EXCITEMENT IN THE NIGHT.</small></h2>


<p>Nick Carter was seated alone in the room that had
been assigned to him.</p>

<p>It was rather more than an hour after midnight, and
the guests of the house had retired to their respective
rooms, and it so happened that Chick had been roomed
in an entirely different part of the house from Nick.</p>

<p>The detective was uneasy in his mind. The atmosphere,
somehow, seemed filled with portent of some
sinister kind, and he could not define just the feeling
that was upon him.</p>

<p>No further opportunity had been obtained for conversation
with Nan Nightingale since that talk in the
corner of the veranda; indeed, when Nick returned
downstairs, after his inspection of Nan’s rooms, and
the encounter, at the door of them, with Jimmy, the
party had divided itself into groups, some of which
were playing cards, and others were indulging in music
and the usual occupations of an evening of that sort.</p>

<p>But Nick was uneasy about Nan.</p>

<p>He realized that Jimmy could protect himself only
by casting suspicion upon the songbird of the stage,
and Nick knew that Jimmy would not hesitate to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
that very thing—if it happened that the opportunity
was offered him.</p>

<p>The detective’s own impotency, so far as Jimmy was
concerned, was apparent, and the reader must understand
that, too.</p>

<p>Put yourself in his place for a moment.</p>

<p>Nick Carter could not arrest Ledger Dinwiddie
and charge him with being Bare-Faced Jimmy Duryea,
without the ability to produce proofs of the assertion—and
Jimmy was undoubtedly prepared to meet
and to refute all such charges; was prepared to prove
his claim to the name and reputation of Ledger Dinwiddie,
and therefore to establish a sufficient alibi to
whatever charge the detective might bring against him.</p>

<p>Nick Carter could not charge Ledger Dinwiddie
with the theft of the jewels, because there was absolutely
no evidence against him to support such a
theory; there was only the statement of Nan, that she
had seen him with them in his possession, in the
library, during the night when they were stolen. That
would be the unsupported word of one person against
another—and Jimmy, as Ledger Dinwiddie, would
not come off second best in such a scene. Nan could
not, or at least would not, deny her past history, if it
came to a show-down, and Jimmy would have to deny
only that he was Jimmy, and to bring forward his
proofs that he was, in reality, Dinwiddie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick had had no opportunity to find out the exact
location of Chick’s room. Rooms had not been assigned
to either of them until it was too late to do
that.</p>

<p>“It is a remarkable circumstance,” the detective
told himself, in thought. “Here is a case where I
know to a certainty the identity of the thief, and yet
have no means of establishing the fact; a case where
I know, approximately, where the stolen property is
concealed, and yet I dare not make an open search for
them; a case where the criminal is in a position to look
me in the eyes and defy me, simply because his own
proofs are far better and more convincing than any
that I can supply.”</p>

<p>It was a remarkable circumstance.</p>

<p>The detective was cogitating upon these conditions
when there came a low tapping against the panel of his
door, and he sprang to his feet, snapped off the electric
lights, and opened the door.</p>

<p>The hall outside was only dimly lighted, and Nick
discovered, as he opened the door, the figure of a
woman, clothed in a silken princess wrapper, and
with a large veil, such as are worn in automobiles,
thrown over her head, gliding rapidly toward the top
of the stairs.</p>

<p>Nick followed swiftly, having not a doubt that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
figure was Nan’s, and that she was conducting him to
one of the rooms on the parlor floor for the purposes
of further conversation; but she was so far in advance
of him that he could not see her distinctly, and
he did not dare to call to her lest he should arouse other
members of the household.</p>

<p>But the figure ahead of the detective did not approach
the library door when it reached the parlor
floor of the house; it passed the door, still keeping
far in advance of Nick.</p>

<p>It hastened to the rear of the house, it opened a
door that was there, which gave upon a back porch—and
instantly, when that happened, the air was filled
with the ringing of gongs, and the house itself—all
of it, it seemed—was flooded with light.</p>

<p>Nick Carter realized at once, if too late, just what
had happened.</p>

<p>The opening of that rear door had set off the
burglar alarms in the house. Automatically it had
switched on the lights in the house—and Nick understood
that it was not Nan Nightingale he had followed,
but Jimmy Duryea. Jimmy, in a woman’s
wrapper and with the veil over his head, so that in the
dim light, and with the hasty glance through the partial
darkness, Nick Carter would not be able to recognize
him.</p>

<p>When that rear door opened, and the figure passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
through it; when the lights flashed on, and the ringing
of the alarm gongs began their din, Nick Carter
leaped forward toward the open door; but only to trip
and fall headlong in the hall before he had taken three
more steps. He had tripped over a rope that had been
stretched across the hallway, purposely to catch him.</p>

<p>As he fell, he heard the whir of an automobile engine,
and the chug-chug of the machine as it started
forward. As he sprang to his feet again, he not only
knew that he was too late to overtake it, but he realized
that he had fallen into a trap of some sort that had
been carefully prepared by Jimmy Duryea.</p>

<p>Men think quickly in emergencies like that one; and
Nick’s first thought as he leaped to his feet was that
the crux of the occasion remained inside the house, and
that the apparent escape from it could be nothing more
than a blind.</p>

<p>Of course the house was instantly in an uproar.</p>

<p>Doors opened and closed. Heads and shoulders were
thrust over the balustrades. Voices called from above,
demanding to know what was the matter. Men and
women appeared from every conceivable quarter, in
all stages of dress, and undress. Foremost among
them, incased in a bathrobe which he was tying around
his person, was Jimmy Duryea, otherwise Mr. Ledger
Dinwiddie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Behind him appeared the owner of the house, Theodore
Remsen. He was followed by Mrs. Remsen, and
by Lenore. Other guests, in various conditions, so
far as clothing was concerned, appeared on the stairs,
all demanding with one voice, almost, to know what
had happened.</p>

<p>Nick Carter was the only person in that motley
group who was fully clothed; but even as he turned
to face those who were rushing toward him he noticed
that there were two absentees.</p>

<p>Nan Nightingale and Chick were nowhere to be
seen.</p>

<p>Because Nan was not there, Nick instantly felt undefined
misgivings; because Chick was not present,
Nick experienced a certain amount of assurance, for
he knew that unless Chick were otherwise employed,
he would have been among the first to put in an appearance.</p>

<p>It was Jimmy Duryea who gave expression to the
first coherent thought, in the midst of that scene. He
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Carter, if it is a part of the practice of
your profession to scare us all to death, you might have
given us some warning of it.”</p>

<p>“There has been a burglar in the house!” shouted
one of the women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Some one entered my room, and stole——”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, I never was so frightened in my life.
I——”</p>

<p>“Did he get away?”</p>

<p>“It was a woman. I saw her. She ran out at
that——”</p>

<p>“Where is Miss Nightingale? She isn’t here. Perhaps
she has been murdered in her sleep. Oh, it is
horrible. I wish——”</p>

<p>And so on, and so on, ad libitum, ad infinitum. Half-finished
sentences, all of them. Excitement everywhere,
and then a general rush toward Nan Nightingale’s
rooms to find why she was not among them. Hysterical
cries from the women; reassuring expressions from
the men. Expressions of wonder at the din of the
alarm, and at the sudden appearance of the lights—and
then, the interior of Nan’s suite of rooms.</p>

<p>Nan Nightingale was not there.</p>

<p>Everywhere within those rooms were evidences of
disorder, but Nan Nightingale, herself, had disappeared.</p>

<p>More than that, it was discovered, presently, that
many of her effects had disappeared with her. In one
of the rooms, where the maid slept, the maid herself
was discovered, deep in the stupor of a drug which
was supposed to be chloroform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>One by one the house guests crowded into the parlor
of Nan’s suite. Some of them remained standing;
some of the men perched themselves upon the arms of
chairs, or upon the edges of tables; the women dropped
upon chairs, or upon hassocks, and without exception
they gazed at one another in utter consternation. Then,
one by one, they began the recounting of the experiences
of the night, which was still young, for it was
not yet two o’clock.</p>

<p>Chick was not there, and, strangely enough, nobody
seemed to have noticed his absence.</p>

<p>Without giving in detail all that was said at that
informal meeting in Nan’s boudoir, suffice it to say
that there was not a woman present who was not willing
to swear that she had seen or heard some person
in her room; and in the midst of it all Lenore Remsen
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“But why should a burglar have carried Nan away?”</p>

<p>Every one was silent; then the voice of Duryea:</p>

<p>“Little goose! She wasn’t carried away. She ran
away.”</p>

<p>“But why? Why?”</p>

<p>“My dear, there could be only one reason. Carter
was right behind her. She had to escape, or get
caught, and she took the former course. I caught a
glimpse of her as she ran through the rear doorway,
and apparently jumped into a motor car. That must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
have been held there by an accomplice who was waiting
to take away the spoils; the swag, I believe they call it?
Eh? Carter? You’re a detective. You ought to
know.”</p>

<p>Every eye in the room was turned upon Nick Carter
then.</p>

<p>The situation was a clever one, adroitly arranged by
Jimmy Duryea.</p>

<p>Nick met their looks calmly, and he replied quietly:</p>

<p>“I ran after a person, but it was not a woman. It
was not Miss Nightingale. Of that, I am certain.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, Carter, what’s the use of all that?” exclaimed
Duryea. “I saw her, too. She wore some sort
of a red wrapper, and an automobile veil, and——”</p>

<p>“And trousers under the wrapper, and a mustache
under the veil,” the detective interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Then where is Nan Nightingale?” demanded Theodore
Remsen, stepping forward.</p>

<p>“She has been abducted,” replied the detective coolly.</p>

<p>“Abducted? Nonsense! By whom?”</p>

<p>“By a scoundrel named Jimmy Duryea, known to
the police as Bare-Faced Jimmy, all-around crook and
expert cracksman. Just now the man is posing under
another name, and is imposing upon certain confiding
people, who believe all that he tells them. But, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Remsen, the time has come to denounce him, and
now——”</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly. A figure had appeared in the
doorway, and all turned to follow Nick Carter’s glance.</p>

<p>It was Nan Nightingale who stood there, facing
them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.
<br />
<small>A PLOT MOST FOUL.</small></h2>


<p>But it was Nan Nightingale, fully dressed as she had
been when the members of this oddly assorted group
had parted with her at retiring time, not arrayed in
a red wrapper, and with an automobile veil thrown
around her head, who faced them all.</p>

<p>She was strangely composed, too, although a trifle
pale, as she entered the room and paused beside Nick
Carter.</p>

<p>“Will some one please tell me what has happened?”
she asked. The question was a general one, addressed
to all alike, but she looked at the detective when she
uttered it. And, she added, speaking directly to him
this time: “I heard only the latter part of what you
were saying. You said that the time had come to denounce
some one. Who was it?”</p>

<p>She was outwardly calm and collected, though exceedingly
pale. Nick realized that Nan was trying to
convey some sort of intelligence to him, with her eyes;
but he could not read it, for truth to tell he was as
greatly amazed as were the others by her sudden appearance
among them.</p>

<p>Before he could reply, Duryea took the centre of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
stage, so to speak. He thrust himself forward, into
the limelight, if the expression may be used here, and
with a smiling sneer on his handsome face, confronted
Nan and Nick, both.</p>

<p>“I will tell you who it was, Miss Nightingale—and
I call upon all who are here to let me finish what I
have to say. If there are others here who have comments
to make upon my statements, let them be made
afterward.”</p>

<p>He paused an instant. No one spoke. Nick Carter
believed that it was best to let the man have his head at
that moment. The detective had not seen through the
plot, as yet, and it was necessary that he should see and
know more about it before he continued with the denouncement
he had intended to make. The things that
Duryea intended to say might have some effect upon
what Nick Carter would say in reply. Nick Carter
waited; and he placed a restraining hand upon the arm
of Nan, to bid her wait, also.</p>

<p>“What is it, Ledger? What have you to say about
this?” asked Theodore Remsen, turning to him. “Do
you mean to tell us that you know something about it?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do, Mr. Remsen,” was the reply. “It
was because I already knew something, and believed
that we would yet catch the thief who stole Lenore’s
necklace and the other jewels, that I advised the repairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to the burglar alarm, which worked so perfectly
to-night. I anticipated precisely this result.”</p>

<p>“Go on; go on, Ledger. Come to the point. Don’t
beat about the bush!” exclaimed Lenore’s father.</p>

<p>Jimmy deliberately turned his back upon Nan and
Nick; he faced the other members of the company.</p>

<p>Pausing just long enough to give emphasis to what
he would next say, he continued:</p>

<p>“I arrived here last Thursday, as you will remember.
I made my first appearance before you at the
dinner table. There was one guest who was in the
house at that time, and who is present now, in this
room, who did not appear at the dinner table that
night. I did not then know that that guest was here.</p>

<p>“Many of you will remember that we passed a
pleasant evening, and that the guest to whom I have
referred did not come downstairs at all during it.
Also, that we parted early and that I complained of
being very tired with my long ride.”</p>

<p>There were nods in the affirmative, around the room.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding the fact that I was greatly
fatigued,” he continued, “I could not go to sleep. Some
time during the middle of the night I left my bed,
partly dressed myself, and descended to the library
to obtain a book, intending to read myself to sleep;
but, as I stepped into the library, I discovered that it
was occupied, and that one of the persons who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
there was the guest to whom I have referred, and
who was not present at the dinner table.</p>

<p>“That guest, as you may have surmised, was a
woman. She was not alone when I discovered her in
the library. There was a man there, with her, and
they were bending across the library tables, conversing
in whispers, so low that I could not hear what was
said. At the moment I did not suspect more than a
clandestine meeting—and, inasmuch as I recognized
the aforesaid guest as an old acquaintance, and knew
a great deal about her, I was not surprised.</p>

<p>“I withdrew, as silently as I had gone there; and as
I did so I heard just one remark that passed between
the two. It was made by the man, to the woman,
and he said: ‘Very well, then. I will return here
next Monday night.’”</p>

<p>Jimmy paused a moment to permit his words to
take full effect.</p>

<p>“The day following, which was Friday,” he continued,
“I was duly presented to the woman in question.
She did not remember me, or if she did, succeeded
in concealing the fact from me, as well as from
others. Some years have passed since I saw her, and
at that time she was—well, she was associated with
the notorious character whose name has been mentioned
by Detective Carter to-night; with the notorious
Bare-Faced Jimmy Duryea, who is now dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
although Mr. Carter seems not to know that fact. I
will say one word more about that man, although it
pains me to do so. He was a burglar, a thief, everything
that was bad and low, but he was my cousin, and
his real name was the same as mine. Moreover, there
was a personal resemblance between us. I can tell
more about him when the proper time comes.”</p>

<p>Again he came to a pause, and found this during it
to glance exultingly around toward the detective. Then
he continued:</p>

<p>“That day, Friday, it became known that certain
jewels had been stolen from this house. I was instantly
convinced that the woman had stolen them;
also that she had taken them after the hour when she
met the man in the library, because there had not been
time, or opportunity, then. But I said nothing to anybody,
until to-day, on the lawn, when, in a conversation
that happened after the arrival of the detective,
I ventured the opinion that the thief was a woman.
But I determined to keep careful watch to-night.</p>

<p>“Now I am coming down to the explanation of
present circumstances. I went to my room, determined
to keep watch; but I half undressed, and I was
sleepy. I fell asleep in my big chair. I was aroused
from that sleep by the clanging of the burglar alarm,
which I advised Mr. Remsen to have fixed, and which
was done yesterday. I rushed into the hall, and down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the stairs. I saw that same woman to whom I have referred
passing rapidly through the lower hall, and
directly behind her was Nick Carter, evidently in pursuit.
But as I looked the detective tripped over something,
and fell. The woman ran out at the rear door,
which had been opened for her escape, and which
act set off the alarm, thus enabling me to discover
her.</p>

<p>“She sprang into a motor car. She wore a red
wrapper and an automobile veil; but I recognized her,
nevertheless. Nick Carter thinks it was a man in disguise,
or he says he does. But I know it was a woman,
and that woman stands—<em>there</em>!”</p>

<p>He wheeled and pointed an accusing finger at Nan
Nightingale, who shrank away from him as from a
loathsome thing.</p>

<p>“Deny it if you can Nan Nightingale, alias Nan
Drummond, and alias many other names!” he cried
out. “And you, Nick Carter, deny if you can that
you knew this woman when she was Nan Drummond,
a thief, and the wife of Bare-Faced Jimmy Duryea,
the crook.”</p>

<p>It was a clever statement, cleverly devised, cleverly
delivered.</p>

<p>It had all the effect that Jimmy anticipated.</p>

<p>The women in the room shrank away from Nan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and looked at her askance. It was evident that it did
not occur to them to doubt Ledger Dinwiddie’s statement.</p>

<p>“I will hear all of your remarkable story, Jimmy,
before I reply to it,” said the detective quietly. “That
isn’t all, is it?” He put out one hand and grasped
Nan’s arm, holding her firmly, to give her courage,
for he did not want her to faint just then.</p>

<p>“No; it isn’t all,” said Jimmy, as coolly, in return.
“There is more.” He turned again toward the others.
“Nick Carter knows the history of Nan Drummond,
who calls herself Nan Nightingale, as well, or better
than I do. He secured her a position on the stage,
when she gave up thievery. He has been her sponsor
ever since; and now I can see just how she has played
upon his belief in her. When she went to the city,
Saturday, and remained over Sunday with Mrs. Remsen,
she must have looked him up. She must have
told him—not that I was here, but that Jimmy Duryea,
the burglar, was alive, and here under an assumed
name. I have mentioned the fact that we were
cousins, and resembled one another.</p>

<p>“The proof of my assumption is that when I was in
the summerhouse alone with Nick Carter, during
the shower of this afternoon, he actually charged me
with being that same Bare-Faced Jimmy, here under
disguise, and he demanded that I leave this place at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
once, and forever forego my hopes of making this
beautiful girl, here, my wife. That I laughed at him
goes without saying; that he did not mention what
had passed between us to others is sufficient proof
that he had made a mistake.</p>

<p>“Now, two things more: I do not know what part
of this woman’s plot it is to have returned here now,
as she has done, fully dressed, after having made her
escape with a wrapper on and a veil over her head,
but she will probably tell you some cock-and-bull
story in regard to it, in order to establish her innocence.</p>

<p>“The other thing is this: Those jewels that she
stole, unless she has had opportunity to-night to pass
them on to her confederates, are concealed somewhere
in these rooms, without a doubt. That is all,
my friends. Now, Nan Drummond, do you deny that
you are Nan Drummond?”</p>

<p>“Don’t reply to him, Nan,” said Nick, speaking
quickly.</p>

<p>“Do you dare, woman, to deny that you were once
the wife of Bare-Faced Jimmy Duryea, the crook
and burglar?” thundered the supposed Dinwiddie, still
addressing Nan, who shrank away from him until she
rested her body against Nick Carter.</p>

<p>“Don’t answer,” said Nick, again.</p>

<p>“Then you answer for her!” cried Jimmy, wheeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
upon the detective, and playing his part to a finish.
“You answer for her. You know all about her. You
know that she was Nan Drummond. You know that
she was once a thief. You know that she was everything
else that was low and——”</p>

<p>Jimmy got no farther than that.</p>

<p>Somewhere, in the past, we have said that Nick
Carter rarely let his temper act for him. But, like
all men, he has a temper, and Jimmy Duryea had
tried it sorely, in more ways than one, since Nick’s
arrival at The Birches.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that Nick exactly lost it at just
that moment, but it is certain that he permitted it to
act just long enough to stop Jimmy’s mouth, and to
stop it effectually, too.</p>

<p>The detective stepped forward, loosening his grasp
upon Nan’s arm.</p>

<p>For just an instant he peered into the face of Jimmy
Duryea, and then he acted.</p>

<p>His right fist shot forward, and it struck Jimmy
squarely upon the jaw; and Jimmy went down like
a clod of earth that is thrown from a shovel.</p>

<p>Some of the women there cried out. The men
uttered various exclamations, and several of them
rushed forward at once. There was a commotion outside,
in the hall, and the local constable, with two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
three men to assist him, rushed into the room. Evidently
they had been brought there for the occasion
by Jimmy Duryea.</p>

<p>But they halted at the aspect of Nick Carter, who
stood facing them, directly over the figure of the prostrate
man on the floor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.
<br />
<small>THE DIAMOND NECKLACE.</small></h2>


<p>“Stand back, all of you!” said Nick Carter, facing
them all. “This man on the floor is my prisoner,
and the one among you who attempts to interfere with
me now will be sorry.”</p>

<p>The constable and his assistants halted; they hesitated;
and then Mr. Remsen pressed forward toward
Nick.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter; Mr. Carter,” he expostulated, “you
are going beyond your authority. You had no right
to strike Mr. Dinwiddie. You——”</p>

<p>“One moment, Mr. Remsen. As an officer, I admit
that I had not the right to strike him in the way I
did; but as a man, I not only had every right, but
it was my duty. He was defaming a good woman,
and doing it in a shamefaced manner that long ago
earned him the title he bears—for, in spite of all that
he has said, this man is none other than that very
Bare-Faced Jimmy he has been talking about.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you brute! you brute!” cried Lenore, striving
in vain to escape from her mother’s detaining arms.</p>

<p>Nick merely glanced at her and murmured, “Poor
girl!” then he went on, addressing the constable, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
was still reluctant to perform what he considered to
be his duty.</p>

<p>“Where did you come from?” Nick demanded of
the constable.</p>

<p>“From the village,” was the reply. “What is that
to you, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“You’ll find out what it is to me presently. Who
asked you to come here?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Dinwiddie; that man there, whom you knocked
down.”</p>

<p>“And why did he ask you to come here?”</p>

<p>“He told me that there had been a jewel robbery,
and that if I was on hand at this hour to-night, he
would expose the thief, and that I would get the credit
for the arrest.”</p>

<p>“I thought so. He had it all nicely arranged, didn’t
he? When did he tell you all that, Mr. Constable?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t tell me; he sent a letter by one of the
grooms. But he had seen me yesterday, and had given
me an inkling of what would happen. And, now stand
aside. I want that woman whom he has exposed. I
arrest her——”</p>

<p>“No you don’t. You won’t arrest anybody, Mr.
Constable, unless you have a warrant, which I doubt;
and if you have one, and serve it, you’ll regret it as
long as you live. You won’t make any arrest, just
now, unless I direct it, constable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who says I won’t? I——”</p>

<p>“I say so. I have the warrant, constable.”</p>

<p>Duryea was beginning to move; he was recovering,
and quick as a flash Nick Carter bent forward and
snapped handcuffs on his wrists.</p>

<p>“Stop that!” cried Mr. Remsen. “You cannot
arrest that man, here, Mr. Carter. He is my guest,
and you are my guest. You are abusing my hospitality—and
besides, just now you said that no arrests
could be made without a warrant.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter turned to Remsen. He spoke quietly,
and in a kindly tone.</p>

<p>“Mr. Remsen,” he said, “I have two duties to perform
here to-night, and one of them, in particular,
supersedes all the claims that might be made in the
name of hospitality. I am doing you a very great
service in saving your daughter from that man on
the floor. He is as vile a scoundrel as ever went
unhung. He is Bare-Faced Jimmy, the crook. He is
the one who stole the jewels, and who has now tried
to charge it upon a defenseless woman, after slandering
her in a way that requires no answer. That is
why I told Miss Nightingale not to speak.”</p>

<p>“But the warrant! The warrant!”</p>

<p>“I have it here, Mr. Remsen. I secured it before I
left the city. It is a bench warrant and is good anywhere
in the State—and it directs me to arrest and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
hold the person of James Duryea, alias Ledger Dinwiddie,
alias Bare-Faced Jimmy. Here it is. Are
you satisfied as to that?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes,” reluctantly.</p>

<p>“He told you partly the truth, regarding that scene
in the summerhouse, for he did have the face to
defy me. I offered him his liberty, if he would leave
the country, after returning the jewels he had stolen;
but he dared to face me; to claim that he could
prove that he is Ledger Dinwiddie, and not James
Duryea.”</p>

<p>“But where is the man who was in the library with
Miss——”</p>

<p>“He is there, on the floor,” replied Nick, interrupting.
“The real circumstance is just the reverse from
the manner in which he told it. It was Miss Nightingale
who found him there. He had the jewels in his
possession at the time. She saw them. That was
why she asked me to come out here to-day—and even
you will admit that I came here upon her invitation.”</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t Nick Carter produce the jewels, since
he seems to know so much about them, Mr. Remsen?”
said a drawling voice from the floor, and then they
saw the fallen Ledger Dinwiddie draw himself to a
sitting posture, and attempt to caress his bruised jaw
with his manacled hands.</p>

<p>“I think I can do that, too, now that the time has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
come,” said the detective, smiling. He turned to Mrs.
Remsen, who had drawn nearer to Nan, and was
now holding her by the hand.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he said, “I wish to ask you a few questions
about the interior arrangements of your house;
that is, about some of its ornamentations. Will you
indulge me?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir. What is it?”</p>

<p>“Before I ask the questions, I wish to make a statement
for all of you—and if you interrupt me, Jimmy,
before I have done, I’ll put a gag in your mouth. Just
for the present, I am running this show, as you may
have noticed.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead and run it, then. I’ll do my talking after
you have exploded all your detective theories.”</p>

<p>“The statement is this, Mrs. Remsen. During that
scene in the summerhouse with this scoundrel on the
floor, I suspected that he had concealed the jewels
somewhere in the rooms of Miss Nightingale, because
he openly threatened to accuse her of the theft.</p>

<p>“This evening after dinner, I came to these rooms
and examined them, hoping that I could find where he
had concealed them; but I was unable to do that. I
was not able to discover anything that suggested a
possible hiding place, although I searched as thoroughly
as I could do so, while I was here. When I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
went out, I encountered the real thief in the hall,
waiting for me.</p>

<p>“He ran away before I was able to stop him. He
descended the stairs ahead of me; but a very few minutes
later, he was missing from the rooms downstairs,
and I suspected that he had returned here. I concluded,
in fact, that when I saw him in the hall, as I
went out of these rooms, he had not followed me there,
and did not suspect that I was there, but had gone there
on some errand of his own.</p>

<p>“Now, madam, I have not been inside of these rooms
since then, but nevertheless, in the short time that I
have been here, I have discovered a certain change
in the ornamentation of this particular room. I will
ask you to look carefully about you, and to tell me if
you perceive any change. Please do so. You, also,
Nan.”</p>

<p>Both women turned.</p>

<p>Everybody else in the room, including the nonplused
constable and his three men, did the same.</p>

<p>Nan and Mrs. Remsen searched with care, using
their eyes, but both of them presently shook their
heads negatively.</p>

<p>“I see no change, Mr. Carter,” said Mrs. Remsen.</p>

<p>“And you, Nan, do you observe none?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“No,” she replied. “What do you mean, Mr. Carter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not reply to her. He turned again to Mrs.
Remsen.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he said, “I have observed, since I have
been a guest in your home, that you are evidently a
collector of rare vases. Is that true?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; it has always been a hobby with me. But
what——”</p>

<p>“In every room that I have entered, there are several,
but in no case have I noticed two that are exactly
alike. Will you tell me if you have two vases
that are precisely alike, now in your possession?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, now that you speak of it, there are
two. But——”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, but will you tell me where those two
vases are, now? Is one of them in this room? Don’t
squirm, Jimmy. We’re getting warm, I know, but
please remember that you are not to interrupt unless
you want a gag in your mouth. Madam, is one
of the vases, of which you have two alike, now in this
room?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Mrs. Remsen pointed toward a vase that
stood upon a bracket in one corner of the room. “That
one, there.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. That is what I thought. Now, will you
tell us where the other one—the one that is precisely
like this one—is located at the present moment, to
the best of your knowledge?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, it is—or at least it should be—in the parlor
of the red suite.”</p>

<p>“And who occupies the so-called red suite of
rooms?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Dinwiddie.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. Now, I have not been inside the rooms
occupied by Mr. Dinwiddie, as you call Jimmy, here,
so I will have to ask you if those two vases are, in
reality, precisely alike. Has not one of them been
broken at some time, and mended?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, as a matter of fact, one has. That is
how I came to have two of them. A gentleman who
was staying with us last fall broke one, but he found
another like it and sent it to me after I had had the
broken one mended.”</p>

<p>“Madam, did it happen that the gentleman referred
to was Mr. Dinwiddie?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, sir. It was Mr. Dinwiddie.”</p>

<p>“And the broken vase—the one that was mended,
I mean—is it now in the red suite that has been occupied
by Mr. Dinwiddie since last Thursday?”</p>

<p>“No,” she replied, pleased that he had asked the
first question that called for a negative reply. “I thought
he deserved to have the good one in his room, so I
put it there, and brought the one that had been broken
to this room. There it is now.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. Will you be so good as to examine it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
more closely, so that you can assure yourself that you
have made no mistake in regard to it?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Remsen crossed the room to the vase. She
raised it from the bracket, and held it in her hand for
a moment. Then she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Why, this is strange. This is the vase that was
broken; and there is something inside of it that I
never noticed before.”</p>

<p>“The jewels, Mrs. Remsen, by any chance?”</p>

<p>“No. Something white. It looks like plaster of
Paris. It——”</p>

<p>“Permit me to see for myself,” said Nick, interrupting
her, and he crossed the room with quick
strides.</p>

<p>One glance into the vase was enough. He saw what
had been done, on the instant.</p>

<p>He raised his eyes to Mrs. Remsen; he turned as if
to speak to her; and then, as if it were done entirely
by accident, he permitted the vase to fall crashing
to the floor, where, weakened as it was by reason of a
former fracture, it fell apart into three pieces. The
diamond necklace that was Lenore Remsen’s property
was exposed to view.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.
<br />
<small>THE REVELATIONS OF NAN.</small></h2>


<p>“Found it, didn’t you?” exclaimed Jimmy, with a
return of his old assurance. He had managed to raise
himself to a sitting posture, and to turn about so that
he had a full and uninterrupted view of the exposure,
when it happened. When nobody replied to him, but
remained staring in more or less stupid wonder at what
had taken place, he added: “Now, I wonder how in
the world you knew it was there, Carter? Did Miss
Nightingale tell you where she had hidden it?”</p>

<p>Nick made no reply—in words.</p>

<p>But he did take a hasty stride or two across the
floor, pulling his handkerchief from his pocket as he
did so, and the next instant Jimmy’s jaws were forced
apart, and the soft linen of the handkerchief was
introduced between them.</p>

<p>“I told you that I would gag you if you interrupted,”
said the detective; and then, as Lenore attempted to
rush forward toward her lover, the detective restrained
her.</p>

<p>“Young lady,” he said, “I honor you for your
loyalty. You are ready to fight for, and to defend
with your last breath, the man who has been your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
accepted sweetheart. It is hard for you to believe
that he is not the man he has pretended to be.”</p>

<p>“I won’t believe it. I will never believe it!” she
cried out. “You are no better than a brute to treat
him so, Nick Carter. I hate you!”</p>

<p>Nick smiled down upon her, somewhat sadly.</p>

<p>“Some day you will thank me,” he told her. “In
the meantime, you must be patient. But, tell me. Do
you also hate Miss Nightingale?”</p>

<p>“Hate Nan? No; I love her. But she has had
nothing to do with this——” she stopped; and again the
detective looked at her and smiled. Then, in a low
tone, he spoke to her again.</p>

<p>“Do you believe that Nan stole your necklace?” he
asked, so that the others, who were now examining
it, could not hear.</p>

<p>“No; I don’t.”</p>

<p>“You would never believe that of your friend Nan,
would you?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I would not.”</p>

<p>“But somebody did steal the necklace. Now, who
do you suppose it was?”</p>

<p>“I should sooner think that you did it than that
he did,” she retorted.</p>

<p>At that point they were interrupted by Mrs. Remsen,
and as that lady spoke, all the others in the room
turned and looked squarely at Nick Carter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Carter,” she said, “I would like you to tell
me, if you please, how you knew that the necklace
was inside that vase?”</p>

<p>The question was a cold one. It was not reassuring.
Nick saw that the spectators of the scene were
now regarding him with suspicion.</p>

<p>“I did not know that it was there,” he replied. “I
only suspected it. As I stated before we discovered
it, I was satisfied, by things that the thief said to me,
that he had concealed the necklace in these rooms, or
that he intended to do so. It was part of his plan.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“One moment, please. When I came here to search
for a hiding place for the jewels, the necklace had
not yet been concealed here. I doubt if I would have
discovered it, if it had been. But, as I left the room,
I met him. He turned and ran away. I followed him
quickly, but nevertheless I remembered, afterward—while
I was seated in my own room to-night, in fact—that
in leaving this room I saw on the mantel at the
opposite side of the hall a vase that had not been
there before. I saw it, and noticed it, only from force
of habit in taking particular notice of the furnishings
of every place where I happen to be.</p>

<p>“I could not have told you what vase it was. I
could not have described it. I was merely conscious
of the fact that such a thing was there—and that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
later, when I came to the hallway out there particularly
to look for that extra vase, to see if it was still
in the place where I had seen it, it had disappeared.</p>

<p>“And so, madam, when we all entered this room
a little while ago, I used my eyes in looking at vases.
I saw that the vase that was just now broken was
not in the position that it was when I supposed I had
seen it last. It was not exposed to view in precisely
the same way; and while I was talking, I changed my
position somewhat, so that I could see behind it.</p>

<p>“It was then, madam, that I noticed the fact that
this vase here had been broken, and mended; also that
it was a long time since it had been mended. <em>I knew
that the vase that was here when I came to this room
earlier had not been broken and mended.</em></p>

<p>“Do you see the deduction?</p>

<p>“There must have been two vases just alike, one of
which had been broken and mended—and the one that
had been broken and mended, had been, during that
short time, exchanged for the perfect one.</p>

<p>“It was only necessary, then, to establish the point
that the other vase had been kept in the room occupied
by Jimmy Duryea, or Mr. Dinwiddie as you know
him. Your answers to my questions established that
fact.</p>

<p>“A moment later, when you said that there was
something white inside the vase that had not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
there before—something resembling plaster of Paris—the
solution of what remained of the problem was
apparent.</p>

<p>“Some years ago there was a great robbery in a
jewelry store, in Paris. Afterward those jewels were
discovered, imbedded in plaster of Paris, at the bottom
of two huge vases that were ornaments in that
store. That robbery was committed by the scapegrace
younger son of a good family in England, whose
people hushed the thing up and permitted him to go
to South Africa on condition that he would never return.
In South Africa, he changed his name to James
Duryea; afterward he came to this country, and was
known here as Bare-Faced Jimmy; still later, he
wormed his way into your household under the name
of Ledger Dinwiddie.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Remsen came nearer to the detective.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter,” she said slowly, “I have heard many
good things said of you. Are you sufficiently positive
of all that you have said to swear to me that you
know it to be true—all of it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam.”</p>

<p>“Nan,” Mrs. Remsen turned to her as she spoke,
“will you explain now how it happened that you were
outside the house, and returned here just when you
did?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Nan. “I will explain. I hope you
will believe me.”</p>

<p>“I see no reason why I should not do so.”</p>

<p>Nan hesitated for a moment. Then she turned so
that she faced the assembled company.</p>

<p>“It is necessary that I explain to all of you,” she
said falteringly. “For a little while I have hoped that
the necessity for it might be escaped; but now I see
that it is essential.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Nan, it is not essential. It need not be,”
said Nick Carter.</p>

<p>“Yes it is,” she replied. “Let me have my way
about it.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Proceed.”</p>

<p>Again Nan hesitated. Then, before she spoke, she
half turned about and opened her arms toward Lenore.
When Lenore hesitated, she said:</p>

<p>“Come here, dear. I want you near me when I
speak, for you, above all others, must believe what
I will tell you now. Come, dear.”</p>

<p>Slowly Lenore moved forward. She seemed to
sense the truth of what was coming, and a dark scowl
crossed the face of Jimmy Duryea. Had it not been
for the gag in his mouth, he doubtless would have interrupted
them, then; but he could not speak, and nobody
offered to relieve him of the impediment to
speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“You must hear all of the truth, now, all of you,”
said Nan, then, with one arm tightly around the quivering
form of Lenore Remsen; “and in order to explain
the circumstance that Mrs. Remsen had asked
about, it is necessary that I should tell other things,
first.</p>

<p>“That man there”—she pointed an accusing finger at
Jimmy—“told a great deal that was true, when he
talked to you a little while ago, accusing me; but he
did not tell all the truth about one part of it, and he
told much less than the truth about another part of it.</p>

<p>“He is not an American. He never had any right
whatever to the name of Dinwiddie, and how he possessed
himself of it I do not know. He is an Englishman.
His real name is James Howard Drummond.
He is the younger son of a titled family in England.
I knew him when I was a girl. I have known him all
my life. As a girl I fell in love with him. As a girl
and woman I still loved him, and finally I became his
wife.</p>

<p>“Hush, Lenore. I am not his wife now. I secured
a divorce from him when he was sent to prison
eight years and more ago. Later, I married again.
But I was his wife, and I am the Nan Drummond
he referred to—his wife, then, when I bore that name.</p>

<p>“It was this way: My family became impoverished.
I sought a position as governess, and went to South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Africa with the family of an army officer. Later,
Howard Drummond came there, also sent out by his
family matters, as he informed me. My old love for
him revived, and we were married.</p>

<p>“Then we came to this country. All the while he
was a thief and a cracksman, and I did not know it—until
later.</p>

<p>“After the discovery, my life seemed an utter wreck.
I permitted myself to be led into crime by that man.
I was afraid of him. He threatened my life if I did
not obey him. Then he was caught and sent to prison,
and I escaped him. And then Mr. Carter found me,
held out hope to me, secured me a position on the
stage, and so helped me back to an honorable life.</p>

<p>“I married a Mr. Smathers, an actor, and he has
since died. Howard Drummond was supposed to be
dead, also. Mr. Carter believed him dead; everybody
who had known him thought the same. I did not
know differently until last Thursday night, in the middle
of the night, when I went to the library of this
house to get a book to read, and found him there with
Lenore’s necklace and the other stolen jewels on the
table before him.</p>

<p>“The recognition between us was mutual in an instant.</p>

<p>“He threatened me with a pistol. He even tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
make love to me again, believing that his old influence
over me still existed. But he found that it did not.</p>

<p>“We were there, in the library, a long time. At
the end of the scene, he promised me that he would return
the stolen property, and that he would leave here
for good and all. Formerly he possessed one virtue;
he would keep his word; so I believed him then.</p>

<p>“But he did not restore the stolen property, and I
threatened him with exposure.</p>

<p>“Then I went to New York with Mrs. Remsen. I
encountered Mr. Carter by accident. I told him everything,
because I knew that there, at least, was one man
who knew the truth about me, and in whom I could
trust.</p>

<p>“And now I come to what took me out of the house
to-night, and so the explanation of my return here
at an unexpected moment—for it was not expected
that I would return—at the least, not until that scoundrel
had won the victory he anticipated.</p>

<p>“Have any of you happened to notice the absence
of one guest from this room? Mr. Carter, will you
call your first assistant, Chick? He is outside waiting.
His presence will help me to explain fully.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.
<br />
<small>THE LAYING OF THE GHOST.</small></h2>


<p>Nick Carter stepped to the doorway, and called
aloud:</p>

<p>“Ho, Chick! Come here!”</p>

<p>A moment later there were steps along the lower
hall, and Chick entered the room where now all were
eagerly awaiting him.</p>

<p>“Thank you for waiting so patiently, Chick,” said
Nan; then she turned to the others again.</p>

<p>“Please remember what I have just told you about
finding Howard Drummond, alias Bare-Faced Jimmy,
and all the other names he has passed under, in the
library, with the jewels in his possession. Remember
that he had promised to restore those jewels, and
that he did not keep his word, and that I induced Mr.
Carter to come here to help me get them.</p>

<p>“When Mr. Carter appeared here, Jimmy, as he
is called, tried to brazen it out, and Mr. Carter told
me about it. I was of the opinion then that the villain
would try to kill me, or Mr. Carter, or both of us,
but Mr. Carter did not think so when we talked it
over on the veranda last evening. Mr. Carter told me
then that he was coming to my rooms to see if the thief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
had concealed the jewels here. The thief saw us
talking together, and evidently decided that he must
act quickly, if at all.</p>

<p>“Later in the evening he sought me, when Mr.
Carter was not near. He managed to draw me aside,
and although he detained me only a moment, he managed
to say in effect that since his interview with the
detective in the summerhouse he had decided to
abandon his entire plan here, and take Nick Carter
at his word; that he had decided to give up the jewels,
and go.</p>

<p>“He agreed to return them to me, with a written
confession that would state the case plainly, if I would
meet him at half-past one o’clock to-night, in the summerhouse
where he had talked with Mr. Carter. The
condition was that I was not to inform Mr. Carter
about it until I could put the jewels into his hands.</p>

<p>“I agreed to that, for I did not think that the
man would dare to do me harm, now that Mr. Carter
was here on the spot. But I did not promise not
to inform Nick Carter’s assistant—this gentleman here,
who is Mr. Chickering Carter.</p>

<p>“I told Chick all about it, and asked his advice. He
advised me to see the thing through to the end, and
said that he would be near at hand if danger threatened.</p>

<p>“At half-past one o’clock to-night, I let myself out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of the house silently. There were no burglar alarms
that sounded then, showing that somebody must have
turned off the power from them to permit me to go
outside.</p>

<p>“I went to the summerhouse, and entered it. There
was no one there, but after a moment two men sprang
upon me from the darkness, I was seized, my hands
were tied, and I was told that if I uttered a sound
I would be killed. Then my feet were tied together
and my own handkerchief was thrust into my mouth
to gag me; and I was left there.</p>

<p>“But it was only for a moment.</p>

<p>“When those men stepped from the doorway of the
summerhouse they were both knocked flat, handcuffs
were put on them, and Chick came into the
summerhouse and set me free. Then he made use of
certain persuasive arguments which induced the men
to talk and tell all they knew, with the result that
we understood that they were to drive an automobile
they had with them, to the rear door, and wait there
until a woman in a red wrapper ran out of the house,
when they were to start the car and go away about
their business.</p>

<p>“I remained in the summerhouse, standing guard
over the two handcuffed men, with a revolver, while
Chick used the automobile as the men had been directed
to use it. Just what the plan was, neither of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
us knew, but Chick decided to be on the spot when it
happened.</p>

<p>“Now, you know when the woman, supposed to be
me, but who was in reality that man there on the
floor, disguised in a wrapper that he had taken from
my room, rushed from the house, don’t you? He
dashed out at the door, and sprang into the car; Chick
started the car ahead, according to the directions that
the two captured men had received; but the disguised
man in the tonneau leaped from the car when it started,
seized a rope ladder that hung from one of the windows
of the red suite, occupied by Ledger Dinwiddie,
ran up it like a squirrel, and disappeared into the
house. A moment later, it appears that he was here, on
the stairs, tying the cord of a bath robe around him.
That was the man of many names, who lies there,
a prisoner now.</p>

<p>“Chick leaped from the car and came to me in
the summerhouse. He tied up the two men so that
they could not escape—and then we came here together.</p>

<p>“But we did not enter the house at once.</p>

<p>“Neither Chick nor I could understand just what
the plot was, or exactly how the thief intended to have
it work out.</p>

<p>“The instructions given to the men were to leave
me in the summerhouse, bound and gagged, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
supposition is that it was part of Bare-Faced Jimmy’s
plan to go there later, and release me, permitting me
to return to the house, where, if I told the story of what
had really happened, I would not be believed.</p>

<p>“For don’t you see, he had made it appear that it
was I who had escaped from the house, pursued by
Nick Carter, who was tripped and thrown by a rope
which Jimmy had stretched in the hallway for that
purpose. How Mr. Carter saw him and gave chase,
I do not——”</p>

<p>“He tapped at my door,” said Nick. “That was
probably a part of his plan. The necklace was to be
discovered in your room, and he was foolish enough
to suppose that even I would believe that you were
more or less implicated.”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Carter,” replied Nan, “he knew that you
would never believe that; but he did hope to implicate
me so deeply that you would be discredited. Perhaps
he did not intend to free me, unless you compelled
him to do so. I do not know.</p>

<p>“Well, when Chick and I returned to the house, you
had all entered here. I came up the stairs alone, telling
Chick that I would call him when he was needed. He
thought that it was better that he should remain outside
for a time.</p>

<p>“My unlooked-for return threw Jimmy entirely
out of his reckoning. He had not expected that. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
his plans threatened to go wrong at once. He was
made desperate by the circumstance. He saw no other
way than to make the bold charge he did against me.</p>

<p>“He knew that I would not deny that I had been
Nan Drummond.</p>

<p>“He dared even to make use of the name of Bare-Faced
Jimmy, claiming cousinship, in order to render
his story the more plausible.</p>

<p>“He told near enough to the truth to give everything
he said the appearance of reality. Once again
he has earned the right to his title of barefaced, for
such a barefaced scoundrel and falsifier, never lived
or dared to live before.”</p>

<p>Nan paused a moment, and then turned again to her
friend Mrs. Remsen.</p>

<p>“That, my dear, is all of my story,” she said. “Much
of it you have heard before, for I thank Heaven that
before I came into your house to live here as your
friend, and to love the stepdaughter who is as dear
to you as if she were your own, I told you all of that
unhappy past history of mine. I did not come here
under false pretenses.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed you did not,” cried Mrs. Remsen, putting
her arms around Nan.</p>

<p>Lenore was quietly sobbing her heart out on Nan’s
shoulder, and now Nan, with one backward glance
toward all who were in the room, led Lenore through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
a doorway into an adjoining room, and closed the door
behind them.</p>

<p>“I have got just a word to say, right here,” said
Chick.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Chick,” said the detective. “We are all
expecting to hear from you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t remain outside the house all the
time things were happening in this room. I went upstairs,
and visited the red suite—the rooms that were
assigned to Mr. Ledger Dinwiddie.”</p>

<p>He paused, stepped to the door, passed out, was
gone a moment, and returned.</p>

<p>“I found these things in that room,” he said. “They
were under the bed, but I found them. There they
are. Look at them.”</p>

<p>He threw the heap to the floor, and all who were
there saw the red wrapper, the big automobile veil,
and the ladder of rope up which Jimmy had clambered
in order to return to his own room in time to be on
the scene.</p>

<p>“More than that,” Chick continued, “I have got a full
confession from one of the men I captured in the
summerhouse, when they attacked Nan.</p>

<p>“Nick,” he turned to his chief, “one of those men is
the chap who used to live on that island where Jimmy
Duryea was supposed to have died. His name is
Griggs. Do you remember him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perfectly.”</p>

<p>“Well, he can supply the truth that Jimmy Duryea
did not die up there. He has already told it to me,
and he will tell it again, whenever he is called upon
to do so.”</p>

<p>Again Chick turned about, facing the assembled
guests again.</p>

<p>“There is just one more thing to tell you,” he said.
“I found a few other things while I was searching
that red suite of rooms. I found these.”</p>

<p>He thrust a hand into his pocket, and drew it forth
filled with jewels.</p>

<p>“Here,” he said, “is, I think, all the stolen property.
If it is not there, the rest of it will doubtless be found
in those rooms.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Jimmy,” said the detective, a little later, “do you
want to make any confession in regard to the Dinwiddie
game you have been playing?”</p>

<p>“When I do, I’ll send for you,” replied Jimmy.
“Maybe you haven’t got me quite so dead to rights as
you think you have.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I have,” replied the detective. “You’ll
get all that’s coming to you, James, before I get
through with you.”</p>

<p>But the detective had somewhat underrated the resourcefulness
of Bare-Faced Jimmy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.
<br />
<small>THE STOLEN IDENTITY.</small></h2>


<p>It was several weeks after the arrest of Jimmy
Duryea that Nick Carter one morning laid aside the
newspaper he had been reading and gave his attention
to the hearty breakfast that had just been put
before him. He made no remark, although Chick,
who was seated at the table at his right, and Patsy
Garvan, his second assistant, who was at his left, and
Adelina—the wife of Patsy—who was opposite him,
all raised their eyes inquiringly to his face, as if they
had confidently expected some sort of a statement from
their chief.</p>

<p>But the detective ate his breakfast in silence; and
the three persons who were closest to him in point of
intimacy respected that silence, and preserved it on
their own several parts.</p>

<p>Never, in the house of Nick Carter, had there been
a more wordless meal.</p>

<p>The two assistants knew what their chief was thinking
about; Adelina’s intuitiveness made her aware of
Nick Carter’s desire for silence. All knew that presently,
when he had thoroughly digested the thoughts
induced by the reading of that article in the paper, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
would say something upon the subject that so strangely
interested each of them.</p>

<p>But he had pushed away the breakfast things and
had carefully selected a cigar from his case, before he
broke that unusual silence; and then he said, addressing
no one in particular, but all of them generally:</p>

<p>“I don’t care a hang what that supreme court judge
says, or how much proof has been brought to sustain
the contention of Bare-Faced Jimmy; not a hang. I
know that the man is Bare-Faced Jimmy Duryea,
otherwise Howard Drummond, and what is more, I
am going to chuck everything else aside until I have
proved it. I won’t let that fellow beat me.”</p>

<p>Chick and Patsy glanced across the table at each
other, and nodded. Adelina replied:</p>

<p>“Nobody has ever supposed that you would permit
such a thing,” she said.</p>

<p>“The thing about it that hurts,” said Nick, “is the
fact that my testimony and all that Nan Nightingale
swore to, went for nothing. I wonder if that judge
thinks me a fool? One would suppose that my reputation
would stand for something; and yet—— Listen
to this paragraph from the learned opinion.”</p>

<p>The detective seized the paper, and read aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘It is one of the most remarkable cases of mistaken
identity that has ever been brought to the attention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
this court. The testimony of Nicholas Carter, the detective,
of his assistant, and of Miss Nancy Nightingale,
would seem to be conclusive, if the evidence they
gave were not so entirely overwhelmed by the voluminous
testimony in contradiction. But where a whole
community comes forward, as in this instance, and
offers what must stand as irrefutable testimony concerning
the identity of the appellant, Mr. Ledger Dinwiddie,
the duty of the court is obvious. Men and
women of advanced years, who have known Ledger
Dinwiddie since his birth, swear to his identity—and
there can be no gainsaying them. Men and women
of approximately his own age, who knew him in his
childhood and youth, who attended school with him,
swear to his identity—and there can be no question
of their entire sincerity. A negro woman who nursed
him in his babyhood, and who watched him grow
to young manhood, swears to his identity, and demonstrates
her fondness for him, now—and her love for
him speaks in his favor even stronger than her words.
On the other hand, the proof offered, establishing the
death of the man called James Duryea, seems incontrovertible.
There is only one conclusion at which this
court can arrive, namely, that Ledger Dinwiddie has
sufficiently established his identity.</p>

<p>“‘The judgment of the lower court is affirmed.</p>

<p>“‘All concur.’”</p></div>

<p>“Now, what do you think of that?” the detective
asked, turning his glance from one to another of his
companions at the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“It sounds to me,” replied Patsy, who was always
plainspoken and who was apt to call things by their
right names, “as if the judge meant to let you down
as easily as possible, chief, but that he evidently believes
you to be one of two things; a——”</p>

<p>“A liar, or a jackass,” Nick interrupted his second
assistant.</p>

<p>“Well, that is putting it rather strong, chief. I
didn’t mean to say exactly that. In the first part of
that lengthy opinion, he cites case after case of mistaken
identity, and tries to show that he hasn’t the
slightest doubt of your sincerity; but all the same he
implies that your zeal has got the better of your judgment—and
that is what hurts most, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Nick, nodding.</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” said Chick, smiling a bit grimly, “Jimmy
seems to be on top at the present moment. He
has established his legal right to the name of Dinwiddie;
he has placed on record, legally, the death of
Bare-Faced Jimmy Duryea. He has won out.”</p>

<p>“For the present—yes.”</p>

<p>“But,” volunteered Adelina, “there is still the charge
against him of the theft of the diamond necklace, and
the other jewels; and there is the unpleasant fact that
he posed as a single man, and affianced himself to
Lenore Remsen from whom he stole the necklace, when
all the time he was a married man. That——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick Carter shrugged his shoulders so significantly
that Adelina stopped. Then she asked:</p>

<p>“What will he do about those charges?”</p>

<p>“He will manage to slip away from them,” replied
the detective; “and, for the present, I am quite content
to let him do so. In fact, I would rather he would
succeed, for the moment.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it an unfortunate circumstance,” asked Patsy,
“that the Remsens should have started away for an
unlimited stay in Europe, the moment after they had
given their testimony?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and no. The additional testimony they might
have given would have done little or no good to our
side of the case; at least, it would not have injured
Jimmy. He would have succeeded in establishing himself
just as firmly as he has now done, if they had
remained. And, when all is said, one cannot blame
them for wishing to get out of the country. It isn’t
a very pleasant experience for people in their position
to have had their only daughter engaged to be married
to a man who is even suspected of having been the sort
of crook that Bare-Faced Jimmy was, to say nothing
of the fact that he was already married.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that is why Theodore Remsen came out
in that interview in the paper and stated over his own
signature that the report of his daughter’s engagement
to Jimmy was all a mistake; was not true, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
that there had never been the slightest foundation for
the report.”</p>

<p>“Of course. Wouldn’t you do the same under like
circumstances?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know but I would, at that.”</p>

<p>“We will not concern ourselves about that part of
the affair,” said the detective. “It is not vital to what
I wish to accomplish in this matter, whether Jimmy
posed as a single man or not, or whether he became
engaged to Lenore Remsen, while he already had a
wife living, or not. It is not particularly vital whether
he stole those jewels, or not—save only from one
standpoint.”</p>

<p>“What is that one?” Adelina asked him.</p>

<p>“That one standpoint is Nan Nightingale,” replied
the detective.</p>

<p>The others were silent and waited for the detective
to proceed with what he was saying.</p>

<p>“The fact of the matter is right here,” Nick continued.
“Up there at the Remsen residence—The
Birches—all of Nan’s previous history was brought
out. She confessed it all herself. She was all right
after that confession—so far as those who were present
and heard it are concerned; but she was not, and is
not, all right in the estimation of thousands of others
who have had only the reports in the newspapers to
direct their thought.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“I see,” said Adelina.</p>

<p>“Aside from those who were present in that house
at the time of the finding of the jewels, when I put the
irons on Jimmy, nine out of ten people believe to this
day that Nan Nightingale knew more about the disappearance
of that necklace and the other jewels than
any other person. So you see for Nan’s sake, if for
no other, the fact that Ledger Dinwiddie is not Ledger
Dinwiddie, but is really Bare-Faced Jimmy, must be
established. It is the only thing that can be done to
set her right, for, in doing it, we also prove that he
was, unquestionably, the thief.”</p>

<p>Patsy got upon his feet and crossed to the window.
He stood there for a moment and then turned about,
delivering himself of an opinion which was by no
means original, since it has been voiced since time
immemorial by thousands of others. He said:</p>

<p>“I’m no lawyer, and I’m glad that I am not; but I
do want to say this: I think that many of the rules
practiced in a court, governing the admission of evidence,
are far from right.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked the detective, smiling.</p>

<p>“Because, as in this affair, every bit of testimony
we relied on relating to the engagement between
Lenore Remsen and Jimmy was ruled out; every question
that Jimmy was asked relating to this wife of his,
who is said to have been a countess, or a duchess, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
something of the sort, was ruled out. We don’t know
a thing about that, officially.”</p>

<p>“Has it ever occurred to you, Chick, or you, Patsy,
to ask who and what that woman, who is now Jimmy’s
wife, has been in the past?”</p>

<p>“It had not—until this moment,” confessed Chick.</p>

<p>“I thought of her only as another possible victim of
Jimmy’s,” said Patsy.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the detective slowly, “in my opinion
you will find that she is a product of the underworld,
just as Jimmy is one. This whole thing was a conspiracy
planned and hatched between those two. This
wife consented to leave him, for the time being, that
there might be no obstacle in the way of his marrying
the millions that Lenore Remsen would have brought
to him.</p>

<p>“After Jimmy had succeeded in getting his clutches
upon the aforesaid millions by divorcing the wife who
has been called Juno, and marrying Lenore for her
money, Lenore would have been put out of the way
quietly, and then Jimmy and Juno would have come
together again to remarry and enjoy the great fortune
which could be obtained only by sacrificing the
life and happiness of a sweet girl.”</p>

<p>“Gee, Nick!” said Chick. “If I thought that——”</p>

<p>“I think it, Chick; and it is because I think it, and
also for the sake of Nan Nightingale, that I am determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
to search this affair to the bottom and to explore
the whole rotten business.</p>

<p>“The weak point in Jimmy’s case is the woman,
Juno,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“Just how do you mean that?” Chick asked his
chief.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you a left-handed answer to that question,”
replied the detective. “I am not going to waste my
time in trying to search out what Jimmy has done and
where he has been since he was supposed to have died
on that island in the Sound.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because the chances are about ten thousand to one
that Jimmy has covered up his tracks so thoroughly
that there would be no tracing him. He’s an adept at
that sort of thing, as you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“There never was a craftier villain on earth than
Jimmy; there never was a more far-seeing one; there
never was a man so well adapted to throwing others
off the scent as Jimmy has proved himself to be ever
since I have known anything about him.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“And, to begin with, we already know that salient
fact about him and his present situation; but the point
is, we cannot prove anything.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“So does he know. And all the time he is laughing
in his sleeve at us. He knows that we know—and he
doesn’t care a rap.”</p>

<p>“That is true enough.”</p>

<p>“And why? Simply because he knows also that we
cannot establish evidence that would be upheld in a
court of law. That has been tried. Jimmy has ceased
to be Jimmy and has become Dinwiddie. His position
from that point is unassailable.”</p>

<p>“I guess you are right about that.”</p>

<p>“But, Chick, there never yet was a fortress so impregnable
that it did not have its one weak spot;
just as the speed of a fleet is determined by the slowest
vessel in it, so is the strength of a fort established
by its weakest spot; and so is the invulnerability of
evidence made vulnerable.”</p>

<p>“And you look upon this woman, Juno, as being the
weak spot in the armor?”</p>

<p>“Precisely.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen her?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of. The name means nothing,
suggests nothing, to me; but a name is of no importance.”</p>

<p>“No; the woman may have had a dozen names.”</p>

<p>“Well, Chick, I am going to look up that woman.
The very circumstance of her being so decidedly in
the background just now, when Jimmy was trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
marry that little Remsen girl, assures me that Juno
was as deeply concerned in the plot, as Jimmy. If she
was as deep in the mud as he was in the mire of it, it
follows as naturally as two-plus-two, that Juno not
only knew Jimmy before she married him, but that
she had lived the same sort of life as he had. I’m
going after that woman.”</p>

<p>“At once?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m going to leave Jimmy severely alone and
trace the woman; but, first, I’ve got to see her; to have
a look at her; to make a sketch of her face.”</p>

<p>“What am I to do in the case, Nick?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to give you the part that is really most
difficult, because it will be less likely to be productive
of results,” replied the detective.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to send you out on Jimmy’s track. I
want you to start at the island.”</p>

<p>Chick nodded.</p>

<p>“I understand,” he said. “You want me to go there
and see what can be found concerning the supposed
death and burial of Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. When the time comes to bring forward
the proofs which I am confident that we shall find—the
stronger we are in that quarter the better it will
be for us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“I see. I’m to keep on that lay, no matter whether
I succeed in digging up anything or not.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Patsy will go with you and assist you.”</p>

<p>“You mean that you will work alone?”</p>

<p>“Not entirely alone. I think I will call upon Nan
for assistance. But I want you and Chick to bear in
mind just one thing.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“No matter what comes to the office in the way of
cases, everything is to be turned down and put aside
until this one is finished. Every energy of this office,
yours, Patsy’s, and mine, is to be devoted to putting
Bare-Faced Jimmy behind the bars. Understand
that?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Thoroughly.”</p>

<p>“Well, with that understanding, go ahead. Be your
own master. Do as you want to do. Do not wait to
ask a question of me. I shall go away this afternoon.
I won’t be back here in this office until I have solved
this case and am ready to put Jimmy where he belongs.
It may take me six days, and it may take me
six months—but if it takes me a year to do it, it shall
be done just the same.”</p>

<p>It was only a few hours later when Nick Carter was
seated in the parlor of the little apartment which Nan
Nightingale called home, in Riverside Drive, and presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Nan entered the room and hurried toward him
with extended hand.</p>

<p>“I know what has brought you here, Mr. Carter,”
she said, as she took a seat opposite him. “I have
read the morning papers containing the report of that
decision—and also an edition of one of the afternoon
papers, which is just out. I was finishing that article
just as you were announced.”</p>

<p>“Something in one of the afternoon papers?” returned
Nick. “What is that? I have not seen it.”</p>

<p>“I have it here. I will show it to you in a moment.
Don’t you think it is a remarkable thing that Jimmy
should so thoroughly have established himself that he
was able to satisfy the court that he is Ledger Dinwiddie
and has not been Bare-Faced Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“Remarkable? Of course it is remarkable. It only
goes to show what a thorough plotter the fellow is.
He had prepared himself for every emergency before
he started on this affair.”</p>

<p>“Yes. He was not so far wrong when he defied you
up there at The Birches, was he?”</p>

<p>“No; and he did defy me, too. He said that he
could prove that he was Dinwiddie, even while he did
not hesitate to admit to me that he was Jimmy. But
what about that article in the afternoon paper? Tell
me about that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“Shall I tell you about it, or would you prefer to
read it for yourself?”</p>

<p>“Tell me about it. I am satisfied that you have
gleaned all there is in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t much; only one of Jimmy’s old tricks.”</p>

<p>“Old tricks? How is that?”</p>

<p>“Why, he has condescended to permit a reporter to
interview him—about his wife.”</p>

<p>“Ah! There ought to be some meat in that—for
me.”</p>

<p>“I think there is. That is why I was so interested
in it.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about it.”</p>

<p>“There is more than a column and a half in the
story that the reporter tells about the interview.”</p>

<p>“Yes? Well?”</p>

<p>“The account starts in by giving a resumé of the
case. It tells how Mr. Ledger Dinwiddie, the last of
his race, broken in fortune, land-poor, left his home
in despair before he was seventeen, and had never
been heard of since then until a short time ago, when
he suddenly reappeared, bringing with him a beautiful
wife.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It tells how old friends of the family would never
permit the lands of the Dinwiddies to be sold for
taxes, and how Jimmy paid up the interest on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
mortgages when he returned, and paid off the taxes.
Then it recites the remarkable case of his being mistaken
for a criminal, and how readily he proved that
he was not—and goes into quite a long explanation of
a distant relationship existing between that dead criminal
and Ledger Dinwiddie, which accounts for the resemblance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Never mind all that, Nan. Get down
to the part about the wife. That is what interests
me most just now.”</p>

<p>“In the interview Jimmy explains to the reporter
that the alleged engagement between him and Miss
Remsen was in the nature of a joke. He admits that
there was some foundation for the report, but says it
was given out at the request of Miss Remsen herself—and,
by the way, there is a printed cablegram from
Theodore Remsen which says that the stated version
of it is substantially correct.”</p>

<p>“Of course Remsen would say that. It lets him
down easy and stops gossip. Go on.”</p>

<p>“The impression that Jimmy succeeds in giving is
to the effect that Lenore Remsen’s father wanted her
to marry a man she did not admire—whose name is
not mentioned.”</p>

<p>“Naturally, since there was no such man. But, go
on.”</p>

<p>“And that it was a put-up job between Jimmy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Lenore that they should pretend to be in love with
each other in order that she might escape the other
man. That is all there is to it, save that Jimmy speaks
at length about his wife, whom he calls Juno.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Well, that is the part of it that I want to
hear.”</p>

<p>“He says that soon after he left his home in Virginia
he made the acquaintance of the young woman,
who is now his wife. That he fell in love with her at
once, but that because he had no means with which
to support a wife, he did not ask her to marry him
until about a year ago. And then, he states, it developed
that she had been in love with him all the
time—and so they were married. A real love match.
He says that he adores his wife and that she is equally
fond of him, and that he makes this statement to the
reporter in order that the world may understand exactly
how things stand, and may not misjudge him, or
her, ever again.”</p>

<p>“The cheek of the fellow is monumental, Nan.”</p>

<p>“It certainly is,” she replied.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.
<br />
<small>A WOMAN OF MYSTERY.</small></h2>


<p>“Where does Jimmy say that his wife is staying?”
asked Nick, after a pause.</p>

<p>“He does not say—more than that she happens to
be absent. He insinuates that she is out of the country—visiting
relatives in her own country, in fact,
although he does not state where that is, or who the
relatives are.”</p>

<p>“I see. At all events she is not in evidence just
now, Nan. Is that the idea?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That is significant, Nan.”</p>

<p>“Is it? Why so?”</p>

<p>“It suggests to me that there is some reason why
she prefers to keep out of sight at the moment when
so much attention is directed toward her.”</p>

<p>“That is very possible.”</p>

<p>“That brings me to the point about which I wished
particularly to question you.”</p>

<p>“What is that, Mr. Carter?”</p>

<p>“Nan, do you remember the occasion of our first
meeting?”</p>

<p>“As if I ever would forget it!” she said reproachfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mean the part of it that you are referring
to, Nan. What I did then, in assisting you to
put behind you forever the life you had been leading
with that man, I would have done for anybody. I
would be glad to do it again for any other woman,
circumstanced as you were.”</p>

<p>“I know that; but it does not render me the less
grateful, for all that.”</p>

<p>“Possibly not. But, Jimmy was just out of Sing
Sing, then, after serving the best part of a four years’
sentence.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I remember it quite well.”</p>

<p>“You told me then, and in subsequent conversation,
that you had known Jimmy when you were children;
that both of you came from good families in England;
that you had gone to South Africa as governess
in the family of an army officer; that a considerable
time afterward Jimmy drifted to that part of the
world also; that your acquaintance, and your childhood’s
romance was renewed, and that you married
him. Then you came to this country together, and it
was not until long afterward that you discovered what
his real occupation in life was. That is substantially
correct, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, Nan, I never knew any of the particulars of
that old life of yours—I refer to the time when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and Jimmy were children. Will you tell me about
that now?”</p>

<p>“Must I?”</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I think that this new woman in the case—this
Juno who is now his wife—also had to do with
that old life.”</p>

<p>Nan shook her head in a decided manner.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “I do not think that.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, it may be so. The woman is some
one who has known all about Jimmy, what he has
been and what he is now. She did not marry him,
thinking he was Ledger Dinwiddie; she married him
knowing who he was, and helped him to carry out the
deception—or, if the plot arose after they were married,
it is all the more proof that she is of his own
kind; a crook like he is.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I agree to that. But—she might have
known him after he went to the bad, and I should
assume that it is more likely that she did.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, tell me something about that old
life.”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Carter; please don’t ask me. At the risk
of offending you I must refuse. I am not the person
I was then. That girl is dead; I will not bring her to
life. I am Nan Nightingale now, and no other. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
if Jimmy should escape his just deserts, because of my
reticence, I would not speak.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Will you do another thing?”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Will you go with me and help to run Jimmy
down?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Anywhere.”</p>

<p>“And for the sake of what I want to accomplish,
will you become one of my assistants for a time?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then that is settled.”</p>

<p>“Wait just a moment, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to think unkindly of me because
I will not discuss my girlhood, will you?”</p>

<p>“No. Certainly not.”</p>

<p>“I will say this much: My father and mother bore
a title. By rights I should have one now; but I am
supposed to have died, and the title that is mine is now
borne by another—and I would not deprive her of it
under any circumstances. Also, there was an episode
in my life then which I do not care to have raked up
again, now, that it is forgotten.”</p>

<p>“Then let it rest.”</p>

<p>“You are sure that you will not think me ungrateful?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure, Nan. Forget it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you. One thing more. You know that
Jimmy’s real name is Howard Drummond; you know
that that is one of the proudest family names in England.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, if in searching and bringing to justice Bare-Faced
Jimmy it should develop to your understanding,
will you keep my secret and never talk about it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I promise.”</p>

<p>“In that case I will assist you all I can.”</p>

<p>“Good. Now let us talk for a moment about this
woman who is called Juno, and who seems to be
Jimmy’s present wife.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Does the name she bears—Juno—suggest anything
to you?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that I may have known her in the
past? No; it does not.”</p>

<p>“Nor her description?”</p>

<p>“I have not heard that. Describe her.”</p>

<p>“First, she seems to be a woman of extraordinary
beauty, and of an uncommon type I should say, from
all that I have heard.”</p>

<p>“Light or dark?”</p>

<p>“A pronounced brunette—rather of the Spanish
type, I should say, from what I have been told; or the
Italian.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“No; it suggests nothing. Perhaps if I should see
her, or a picture of her, it might suggest something;
but at the present moment I have no information to
offer.”</p>

<p>“When you were a child you were—as children are
so—practically in love with Jimmy, were you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I never got over it, either, until I discovered
that he was a professional criminal.”</p>

<p>“Was there not another young woman, or girl, at
that time, who——”</p>

<p>She held up a hand and stopped him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “there was such a girl. It was to
her that I referred when I said that there was an episode
in that past life of mine, when I was a girl, which
I did not care to recall.”</p>

<p>“I see. Tell me something about that girl.”</p>

<p>“Why? With the idea that she may be this Juno?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That is impossible.”</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p>“Because that girl is—dead.”</p>

<p>“My dear Nan, the fact that one is reported dead
does not make that person dead. We have sufficient
proof of that in the present existence of Jimmy
Duryea.”</p>

<p>“But I saw this girl in her coffin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“I supposed that I saw Jimmy in his coffin. You
have not forgotten that, have you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Nor that you were there on that island where he
was supposed to have died, just before his death was
reported? That you, in person, attended what was
supposed to be Jimmy’s funeral?”</p>

<p>“No. I haven’t forgotten any of that. But this
case is different.”</p>

<p>“How is it different? Tell me that.”</p>

<p>“Because in a way I was responsible for the death
of that girl. Oh, I do not want to go into it at all,
please.”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind that part of it, then. Tell me
something about the girl herself. You can have no
objections to that, can you?”</p>

<p>“No; only it pains me to speak of it at all. She lived
near to where I did, and where Jimmy did—or Howard,
as I called him in those days.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“She was two years younger than I, but was more
developed, and looked and appeared that much my
elder. She was a beauty, and, strangely enough, since
you will have it so, she was a pronounced brunette.
Need I tell you her name?”</p>

<p>“Only her given name, at the present time, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
unless there is need of it, I will not ask for the other
one.”</p>

<p>“Her given name was Sarah, and that name became
changed to Siren, which was appropriate in every way.
Everybody who knew her called her Siren, and even
the servants addressed her as the Lady Siren. I suppose,
really it came from that fact that the average
cockney English servant pronounce the letter A like
the letter I. They say tyke for take, and sy for say,
and so they called her Lady Syra, for Lady Sarah, and
Lady Syra became Lady Siren. That is the only way
in which I can explain it.”</p>

<p>“I think it a very reasonable explanation. She was
beautiful as a child?”</p>

<p>“Wondrously so. But I don’t see why we need
speak of her at all.”</p>

<p>“Only because I have the notion that this woman,
who is now Jimmy’s wife, is associated in some manner
with that early life of his. I may be all wrong
as to that view of it, but at least I want to try it out.”</p>

<p>“But this particular girl cannot be, I tell you. She
is dead—more than ten years.”</p>

<p>“And Jimmy has been dead—how long? Yet he is
alive. I will ask you just one more question about
this Siren, and if you can reply to it satisfactorily, I
will drop the subject. The question is this: Did she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
die in quite a natural manner, and at her home,
or——”</p>

<p>Nan raised one hand as if to ward off a blow; then
she replied:</p>

<p>“No. She did not. I see that I must tell you about
it.”</p>

<p>“Please,” replied the detective.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.
<br />
<small>GOING AFTER JUNO.</small></h2>


<p>The tale that Nan told to the detective was given
without names, or localities, more than those already
given here; and the story need not be repeated in detail.</p>

<p>It was the story of a highborn girl, left motherless
at her birth, and fatherless within a few years
thereafter, who is left to the care of governess and
servants, and allowed to run wild and to develop a
thoroughly willful nature to its fullest extent.</p>

<p>Who, from being ungovernable, became unmanageable;
from being reckless, became a wild thing; who
developed a terrible temper; who did things that no
well-bred girl should have done; who insisted upon
having her own way in everything, and who cared not
a whit for the opinions or the criticisms of others—and
who came to the ultimate consequence of such an
ungoverned, non-regulated life, and finally disappeared
from her home.</p>

<p>Nan’s story told how this girl, months afterward,
was found in London, by relatives of the family, in a
hospital, where she was dying. Soon after she died,
and was taken to the house of her ancestors and buried
in the family plot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>That was practically all of the sad story that need
be developed here, and Nick Carter listened to it without
comment.</p>

<p>There was no earthly reason why he should suppose
that the Juno in whom he was interested at that moment
was the girl who had been called Siren in her
youth.</p>

<p>Yet, he had that intuitive feeling that they were the
same—and without a reason.</p>

<p>“Nan,” he said, at the conclusion of the tale, “I
have asked you to assist me in this matter. I had
intended to take you to Virginia with me, believing
that there might be a something about the appearance
of this Juno to associate her with the past of
Jimmy Duryea. But I have thought better of taking
you down there. I will go to Virginia alone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you. I do not care to go.”</p>

<p>“But,” he continued, with a smile, “I shall ask you
to do a more difficult thing; and unless you can and
will do it for me, I shall be compelled to do it for myself.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked, somewhat startled by his
manner.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment. Have you ever been back among
those scenes of your childhood since you left them to
go to South Africa?”</p>

<p>“No,” she replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I want you to go back there and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, no!”</p>

<p>“Either you must go there, or I shall.”</p>

<p>“What is it that you would have me do there?”</p>

<p>“You need not, necessarily, go to the old home.
Your search will be in London, rather than in that
neighborhood. But I want you to search out the career
of that girl from the time she left home until it was
reported that she had died in a London hospital.”</p>

<p>“Must I do that, Mr. Carter?”</p>

<p>“Unless you prefer to leave it for me to do. But
you are in possession of facts which will aid you
materially in such a search, and you can make it more
quickly, because you will know exactly where to go in
doing it. I would lose valuable time in getting those
facts together, unless you related them to me, and you
are reluctant to do that. So go there and make the
search in your own way. I do not require of you all
the names and particulars; all I wish to know is the
result.”</p>

<p>“And you? What will you be doing in the meantime?”</p>

<p>“I shall go to Virginia. I start this evening. I am
convinced that the only weak spot in the armor of
Bare-Faced Jimmy is through that woman, Juno. I
shall search her out in some way. I shall follow on her
back track—if there is one. It may be that my search<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and yours will bring us face to face in the end—and
it may not be. Nobody can tell as to that.”</p>

<p>“No; nobody can tell as to that.”</p>

<p>“So, you will do as I ask?”</p>

<p>“Yes, since you insist upon it.”</p>

<p>“Then you will sail for England to-morrow. I will
see that your passage is engaged on one of the fast
steamers. Chick will come here with the tickets, and
will take you to the steamer. At London you will stop
at Gray’s Hotel, in Dover Street, Piccadilly, at which
place I will communicate with you. You will address
me at my house, and I will arrange so that any message
from you will be forwarded to me at once.”</p>

<p>“What sort of information must I send to you?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“You need send none at all unless it is to the point.
If you find, for instance, that the report of the death
of Siren was not true—if you should become convinced
that the report was a subterfuge of the family,
to put a stop to gossip and to preserve a good name,
you are to inform me of that.”</p>

<p>“But how will that be of any assistance to you?”</p>

<p>“It will assist me only in the dénouement. In order
to compel those two plotters who have stolen the name
of Dinwiddie, to confess their crimes, I must corner
them. The only way in which it can be done is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
threaten them with complete exposure. I think that
even now you are almost in a position to make that
threat, if you would do it. I must attain to that position.
That is all, Nan.”</p>

<p>Nan smiled up at him, sadly.</p>

<p>“Oh, if Jimmy had only died, really, when it was
supposed he did,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes; or if that girl, Siren, had not left home when
she did. What is the use of all that sort of reasoning,
Nan? None at all. You will go?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And try your best to do all that I have asked?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And make reports to me, as I have outlined?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then good-by. I shall be in Virginia in the morning.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was the following evening, at dark,
when Nick Carter arrived in the little village where
the supposed Ledger Dinwiddie had been received with
such acclaim upon his return to “his own,” and with a
wife.</p>

<p>The detective knew that Jimmy was still in New
York, and that was one reason why he hastened his
movements. He wished to be there on the ground, at
Kingsgift, before the supposed heir to it returned.</p>

<p>I wonder if any of the readers realize how entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
remote from the news of the day some portions of
the State of Virginia are, right now?</p>

<p>It is a fact that of two letters deposited in a mail
box in the City of New York, at the same time, one
addressed to Denver, Colorado, and the other to
Hague, Virginia, the former will arrive first at its
destination—for the Hague is sixty miles from the
nearest railway station, and the river boats do not
carry the mails. And this fact will suffice to explain
how it was that nothing was known in that locality of
the strange doings of Ledger Dinwiddie, in New York.</p>

<p>But Nick drove a span of horses from Fredericksburg,
sixty miles away; he arrived at Hague at dark;
he drove on straight through the one street of the village,
and out toward Kingsgift, which is eight miles
farther.</p>

<p>Hospitality is a watchword through all that part of
Virginia.</p>

<p>There are no hotels, or inns, or anything of the sort,
save only in the larger towns, and they are remote
from one another.</p>

<p>If a traveler is caught upon the road at dinner time
and wants a meal he has only to approach the nearest
house, which may stand a mile away from the highway,
and ask for it. He gets it, and he must not offer
to pay for it, either.</p>

<p>The same unwritten law applies to the matter of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
night’s lodging—and Nick Carter intended to make the
most of it upon his arrival at Kingsgift, and had timed
himself accordingly.</p>

<p>It was after eight o’clock in the evening when he
drove upon the estate, and had still another mile to
drive before he could reach the house. In due time
he stopped his horses before the door, got down and
tied them—and by that time a negro servant was at
hand, ready to receive him.</p>

<p>“Hello, uncle,” said the detective. “I suppose your
master can put me up for the night, can’t he?”</p>

<p>“I reckon so, sah,” was the reply. “Mistur Dinwiddie
ain’t to home, sah, but dat don’ make no sort
uh diff’ence, sah. You is welcome, jes de same. Whar
you done come from, sah?”</p>

<p>“I am from the North, uncle.”</p>

<p>“Hush, chile! Is you, now! Dat mus’ be a won’ful
country up dar, sah, from all I hearn tell about it.
Jes you walk right into de house, sah; I’ll take care
of the hosses—an’ they sure is fine ones. Looks to
me like they done come from Fredericksburg. Reckon
I’s seen ’em afore, sah.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you have. Is your mistress at home,
uncle?”</p>

<p>“Well, sah, she ain’t rightly at home, nohow; but
den she am at home, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“How is that, uncle? I’m afraid I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“It’s dissaway, sah. She says to me, ‘Uncle Henery’—dat’s
my name, sah—‘Uncle Henery,’ she says, ‘if
any pusson done ask fo’ me, you tol ’em dat I is not
at home, ceptin’ it’s sure-nuff home folks what asks,
an’ in dat case you can say dat I is at home.’ Dat’s de
way in, sah; right dar. Yo’ jes rap on dat do’ and my
ol woman’ll opin it fo’ you.”</p>

<p>Nick stood still until the negro had led the horses
toward the stable, and then he mounted the steps of
the wide veranda, and rapped with the metal knocker
against the door.</p>

<p>There was a long wait before it was opened, and
then a negress, as black as the proverbial ace of spades,
appeared so suddenly that Nick was startled, for he
had not heard her approach. She peered out at him
after throwing the door widely ajar.</p>

<p>“Hello, auntie!” he exclaimed. “Can you take in a
traveler, and give him something to eat, and a bed
for the night?”</p>

<p>“I reckon so. Yassir. Come right in. You is welcome.
Dar ain’t nobody home ‘ceptin’ me an’ dat
good-for-nothin’ nigger, Henery, but I reckon we can
make you comfortable; yassir.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t your mistress at home?” asked Nick, remembering
what Henry had said on that point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sah. We is de onliest ones to home, jes now.
Come in, sah. Mistuh Dinwiddie, he’s in de Norf
somewheres—I dunno whar—and de missus she’s in
de Souf somewheres—I can’t jes’ tell you where, and
we is de onliest ones yere; dat’s a fact.”</p>

<p>“But Uncle Henery said that Mrs. Dinwiddie was at
home,” said Nick, entering the house.</p>

<p>“Huh! You mustn’t mind what dat lyin’ nigger
done tell you, sah. He’s suttinly de biggest liah dis
side uh de Rappahannock, dat’s what he is. Now, sah,
you jes’ make yo’self comftil till I rustles yo’ somethin’
to eat.”</p>

<p>Before the detective could say another word she
had taken herself off, leaving him alone in the room
into which he had been ushered, where a single kerosene
lamp, heavily shaded, burned upon a centre table.</p>

<p>“So,” he mused to himself, “Juno is at home; and
Juno is not at home. Well, we will see about that,
presently.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.
<br />
<small>JUNO.</small></h2>


<p>The house remained silent while Nick Carter waited.</p>

<p>Indeed there was barely a sound to be heard at all,
even from without, so remote was the place, for Kingsgift,
comprising more than eight hundred acres of
land, much of it forest, was bounded on three sides by
water, and on the fourth by a narrow neck of land
only, so that the nearest neighbor, save for the negro
tenants, lived several miles distant.</p>

<p>While the time passed during which the negress was
preparing food for the detective, he amused himself
by inspecting the room in which he waited. It was
evidently a reception room, used only for the accommodations
of people like Nick Carter, who appeared
there without any definite purpose—apparently—and
presently went on their ways again, never to be heard
of more.</p>

<p>After a time the negress reappeared and invited him
to follow her; and he was conducted to the spacious
dining room where Liza had spread food enough for
three hungry men.</p>

<p>“It’s on’y jes’ a cold snack, honey,” she said apologetically,
“but it sure was de bestes’ I cud do on so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
short notice. Dar ain many strangers what gits in
h’yere from de main road. It suttinly is clar-to-goodnes
clean off’n de trabbled road.”</p>

<p>“So your master isn’t at home, eh?” said the detective,
helping himself to the good things before him.</p>

<p>“No, sah, dat he ain’t.”</p>

<p>“And your mistress is away, too?”</p>

<p>“Yassir; yassir. She done gone away, too.”</p>

<p>“It is rather strange that uncle should have said
she was here.”</p>

<p>“Say, ain’t I done tol yo’ dat my ol man is de hugest-most
liah in de worl’? My, my, yo’ don’ wanttuh go
for to b’lieve wat dat man tells yo’. Tain’t safe, nohow.
He suttinly is de onliest man I know what can’t
tell de truth; he suttinly is.”</p>

<p>“Well, auntie, maybe you can tell me how to go
from here to Hague. I want to go there in the morning,
after breakfast.”</p>

<p>“In de mawnin’? Yo’ jes’ drives ’long de road.
Dere ain’t nothin’ else to do. Reckon yo’ must ha’
come straight through Hague when you done come
yere. When you is quite finished eatin’, sah, I’ll show
you to your room whar you is to sleep, and you kin go
to baid jes’ as soon as yo’ is a mind to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I won’t go to bed right away, auntie. I’ll sit
out there on the veranda and smoke,” said the detective,
rising, for he had eaten his fill. “You can show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
me where the room is, if you wish, and I will go to it
after I have smoked my cigar.”</p>

<p>“Lord bless yo’, sah, you is welcome to smoke right
in yo’ room, all yo’ pleases,” said the woman hastily.
So hastily that Nick decided at once that she wished to
get him stowed away immediately. He was just turning
over in his mind the question as to why the woman
desired that, when he heard the sound of horses’ hoofs
on the roadway, and then a musical voice called from
the darkness:</p>

<p>“Lize! Lize! Oh, uncle! Here I am!”</p>

<p>The negro woman looked appealingly toward the detective,
as if she wished that he would hide himself
away somewhere. Nick stepped quickly to the door,
threw it ajar, and then stood there, framed in the opening,
with the light of the room behind him so that it
fell full upon the face and figure of a woman who had
pulled her saddle horse close to the stepping block, and
was just gathering the reins in her hand preparatory to
dismounting.</p>

<p>She straightened quickly when she saw Nick, and
for an instant it seemed to him as if she was on the
point of urging the horse away again. But if she felt
the impulse, she controlled it; and she said coolly:</p>

<p>“Good evening, sir.” Then she called past Nick to
the negress, adding: “Where is your mistress, Liza?
I rode over to make a call upon her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“She done gone out, missy, jes’ a lil’ while ago, for
sure,” the negress replied quickly, and the detective
could not repress a smile at the transparency of the
falsehood, or, rather, at the attempt to deceive.</p>

<p>It was evident that the woman on the horse’s back
saw the expression on Nick Carter’s face, and read it
correctly, for she instantly broke into a laugh, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, it isn’t the slightest use to tell Aunt
Liza to say that I’m not at home. She cannot understand
how a person can be not at home and in the
house at the same time. But I won’t try to deceive you,
sir. I am Mrs. Dinwiddie, and if you are a stranger,
you are welcome to such hospitality as I can provide.”</p>

<p>She started to dismount, and Nick stepped forward
to assist her; but with a quick, light spring, she was
out of the saddle before he could touch her.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the accent of the woman
when she spoke, or rather, there could be no two
opinions in regard to her enunciation. It was decidedly
English, and yet with so faint a trace of it
that she probably thought, herself, that she spoke
it like an American.</p>

<p>It has been said that the real English sing their
words, and she sang hers, certainly, and with a voice
that sounded capable of singing anything.</p>

<p>“I found myself in this neighborhood a little while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
ago, and made bold to ask for accommodation,” explained
the detective, approaching nearer to her; and
he perceived that she answered very well indeed to the
meager description he had of her.</p>

<p>There was no denying her beauty, or that it belonged
to a class by itself.</p>

<p>She was the brunette that had been partly described
to him; the woman with the luminous eyes, with the
perfect figure, the dark hair, the olive complexion,
which was yet too fair to be olive. She was Juno; he
was assured of that; and hence was the woman with
whom he wished to converse.</p>

<p>As soon as she dismounted and after replying to his
statement with a word or two, she led the way into
the house, and to a sitting room which Nick had not
seen before.</p>

<p>“You are a stranger in this part of the country?”
she said inquiringly, after indicating a chair for him
to occupy, and disposing of her own person on a low
rocker. “Kingsgift is such an out of the way place
that strangers rarely honor us; still, you are welcome.
It is unfortunate that my husband is absent, else he
would entertain you.”</p>

<p>“Madam, thank you,” replied Nick, accepting the
proffered chair. “You are very kind. The truth is,
I was informed that you, also, were absent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Again she indulged in that musical laugh of hers,
which was almost contagious.</p>

<p>“That is a little story of mine,” she said, “but I cannot
make Liza keep to it. Since my husband went
away, I have preferred to keep to myself, and I permitted
it to be thought around here that I had gone
with him—or in another direction. But it makes no
difference. I believe that you have not yet told me
your name, sir.”</p>

<p>“I am Mr. Carter, from New York,” he replied, giving
his own name in spite of the fact that he was partly
disguised. He wished now that he was not.</p>

<p>“Then you are a long way from home, are you not?”</p>

<p>“A very long way; yes, indeed; and my horses were
about played out when I arrived here. I doubt if
they could have gone three miles farther.”</p>

<p>“And you were bound for——” she stopped with
the rising inflection.</p>

<p>“In the morning I will go to a place called Hague,
if some one here will direct me.”</p>

<p>“Did you come from the north?”</p>

<p>“I drove from Fredericksburg.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? And arrived here? Why, you must have
gone directly through Hague, unless you took the
wrong road and came by a very devious course.”</p>

<p>“People who drive along strange highways at night
are apt to take the wrong road, are they not?” he replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
smiling. “But, madam, since your husband is
not at home, I will go on again as soon as my horses
are rested, if you prefer it,” he added.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; there is no reason why you should do that,
sir. Make yourself as comfortable as you can while
you are here. You will excuse me, of course—and, as
I probably will not be up when you leave in the morning,
I will also say good-by.”</p>

<p>She inclined her head, and was gone before he could
venture a protest.</p>

<p>He had hoped that she would be inclined to remain
and talk with him for a while, but such a proceeding
was evidently furthest from her thoughts. And so
Nick Carter found himself alone, almost as soon as
the purpose of his visit was achieved.</p>

<p>For he had accomplished the purpose of that visit,
almost as soon as he saw Juno and heard her speak.</p>

<p>He had satisfied himself of two things; one was
that he had never seen her before, and the other was
that he would be able to recognize her again under
any circumstances.</p>

<p>For a time after she left him he remained standing
where he had risen to bid her good night, watching
the closed door by which she had passed from the
room. He was thinking to himself:</p>

<p>“A wonderful woman! Truly a remarkable woman—and
as beautiful as she is remarkable. No person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
who has ever seen her face and looked into her eyes
could forget either; no one who has ever heard the
sound of her voice could forget it. She has a wonderful
charm; a quick intelligence; a keen perception.”</p>

<p>He stopped at that expression, “a keen perception.”</p>

<p>He asked himself if by any possibility her perceptions
were sufficiently keen to have suggested to her
the explanation of his call there; and he replied to his
own thought:</p>

<p>“If she is the sort of woman I have believed her to
be she would not be deceived by the explanation I offered
of my presence here. She would know at once
that I did not come here by accident.”</p>

<p>However, if Juno knew or guessed such a thing, she
did not show it at all.</p>

<p>She had acted throughout in a perfectly natural
manner. The most critical could have had no fault
to find with her conduct, or with her manner of receiving
the detective.</p>

<p>The negress, Liza, entered the room a moment later,
evidently sent there by her mistress, and the detective
followed her to the room that had been assigned to
him.</p>

<p>An old-fashioned teester bed, surmounted by a resplendent
canopy, waited there to receive him, and he
was tired enough to have taken advantage of its comforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
at once; but another duty demanded his attention
first.</p>

<p>From the lining of his coat, where he had cut a
place to receive it, he drew forth several sheets of
drawing paper; from another pocket, pencils; and then
he drew forward under the light the drop leaf mahogany
table, and set himself to work on a reproduction
of the features of the beautiful woman who had
entertained him so short a time.</p>

<p>He made a profile; he made a full view drawing;
he made a three-quarters. He drew a picture of her
standing; another sketch represented her in the saddle,
as he had first seen her. Still another showed her
seated in the low rocker in the sitting room where she
had talked with him only a few moments.</p>

<p>In all he made eight sketches of Juno, for it was an
art which his father had compelled him to acquire
when he was learning to be a detective—to draw with
great accuracy from memory.</p>

<p>When he had finished them and raised them before
his eyes for his own inspection he nodded his head,
well satisfied with the result he had achieved. He had
eight fairly good likenesses of Juno to work with.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.
<br />
<small>A DANGEROUS WOMAN.</small></h2>


<p>“Without a doubt,” said the chief of the secret
police of Paris, taking the several drawings from the
desk in front of him and examining them one by one.</p>

<p>They were greatly improved since that night when
Nick Carter made them in the room he was occupying
at Kingsgift, in Virginia.</p>

<p>With those original sketches as guides he had made
on the way across the ocean, several finished drawings
of Juno, and these were what he now exhibited to the
chief. Two weeks, lacking one day, had passed since
then, and Nick was in Paris.</p>

<p>He had already visited London and Scotland Yard,
where no information was obtainable—that is, such information
as he sought; but he had determined to visit
every capital in Europe before he returned to the
United States.</p>

<p>The detective was convinced—as he had been convinced
all along—that Juno had a history somewhere
in Europe, and that if he searched for it he would
find it.</p>

<p>He had arrived that morning in Paris and had lost
no time in presenting himself to the chief of the secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
police, who was an old acquaintance. As soon as he
was received in the private office of that great man,
he had said:</p>

<p>“Chief”—we use a free translation of all that passed
between them—“I have here a few drawings, made by
myself, of a woman whom I wish to identify. I think
it more than likely that you will know her. Will you
look at them?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly.”</p>

<p>Then the detective had passed out one of the drawings,
putting it face upward on the desk in front of the
chief; and the latter had exclaimed at once:</p>

<p>“‘The Leopard!’ Of course it is ‘The Leopard.’”
And then he had added as we have noted it down
here. “Without a doubt.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter raised his brows, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“‘The Leopard?’” he repeated questioningly.</p>

<p>“Yes. That is the name by which she is best known,
Carter. She had a different name for use in each one
of the capitals of Europe, but ‘The Leopard’ is the
one by which she is best known, and more generally
recognized. I had been wondering what had become
of her.”</p>

<p>“So you know all about her, chief?”</p>

<p>“All about her? No, indeed; very little about her,
as a matter of fact—and a very great deal about her,
too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“Isn’t that statement of yours rather ambiguous?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is; but it comprehends precisely what I
wished to say.”</p>

<p>“Would you mind being more direct about it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be as direct as I can. What do you desire to
know about her?”</p>

<p>“Everything.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear friend, Carter, but that is impossible.”</p>

<p>“Then all that you can tell me about her.”</p>

<p>“That is different. Yet—if you were to give me
the precise line concerning which you wish information
we might get at it sooner.”</p>

<p>“Why? What is the matter with general information
concerning her?”</p>

<p>“There is no such thing as general information concerning
her. She is not ‘general’ in any sense of the
word. She is a many-sided woman. Young, you will
say? Yes; but not so young as she appears to be.
Beautiful? Ah, as a witch! Fascinating? She is an
houri. There are no words to describe her accurately.
What is the circumstance which leads you to make
inquiries concerning her, my friend?”</p>

<p>The detective hesitated a moment; then he said:</p>

<p>“She is just now engaged, in company with a man
whom we know on our side of the water as Bare-Faced
Jimmy, in rather a large scheme. Jimmy has
stolen the identity of a young Virginian who is doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
dead—it isn’t unlikely that Jimmy murdered him
and that this woman helped him do it. ‘The Leopard,’
as you call her, has married Jimmy——”</p>

<p>“Wait, wait, wait! Married, you say? Impossible!”</p>

<p>“Eh? Why impossible?”</p>

<p>“Because, why should she have married a criminal,
when she could have had her pick of titles over here
many times?”</p>

<p>“That is a question I cannot answer; only there is
no doubt that she is married to Jimmy.”</p>

<p>The chief of the secret police of Paris shook his head
with emphasis.</p>

<p>“Impossible!” he said again, with conviction.</p>

<p>“Why?” repeated the detective.</p>

<p>“Because—ah, who can give a reason for what
women do, or refuse to do? Not I, although I have
been studying them for years.”</p>

<p>“But you have a reason for such a decided opinion,
chief.”</p>

<p>“Assuredly. Of course, Carter. There is a reason.
We have it set down in our <em>dossier</em> of her in the books;
there it is a cut and dried opinion; just a practical one.
Perhaps that is the answer you want to your question.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is. Let me hear it.”</p>

<p>“Wait. I will send for the book.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“No. Tell me about it, and her, first. I would
rather have your version of it. Later, if you will permit
it I will read the <em>dossier</em>.”</p>

<p>“Assuredly you shall read it.”</p>

<p>“Now, what is that cut and dried reason? Tell me
that. I have an idea that it will supply some sort of a
pointer in the investigation I am making.”</p>

<p>“Possibly. Who knows? I have just told you that
she might have had her pick of titles, here in
France; or Austria; or Germany; or Italy; or even
in Russia. Everybody who came in contact with
her fell in love with her. She has been the ruin of a
score of good men in the secret police of several countries.
Two of my own men committed suicide because
of her. She led them to betray their trusts, and so,
dishonored them. Ah, she is a wonder, that woman!
That leopard!”</p>

<p>“But that is not the reason you spoke about for her
not marrying.”</p>

<p>“No, it is this. There was a Duc de Luvois—a rich
man with an honored name, which he offered to bestow
upon her, together with his fortune. He laid
them both at her feet, and she refused them and him.
It was her reply to him that is used now in the
<em>dossier</em>, as the reason why she will never marry.”</p>

<p>“Good. What was that reply, chief?”</p>

<p>“The duke repeated it to a friend of his before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
shot himself after her refusal. ‘She told me,’ he said
to his friend, ‘that there is only one name in all the
world which she will ever consent to bear, and that as
there is small chance of that name ever being offered
to her is not likely that she would ever marry.’ Now
you have it, Carter. That is the cut and dried reason.
Cannot you read between the words all that they imply?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I think so. Still, I would like to have your
version, chief.”</p>

<p>“You shall, then.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“I told you a moment ago that while we know a
great deal about her, we know, in fact, a very little.
When I made that remark I meant that we know absolutely
nothing concerning her history before she arrived
at womanhood. In other words, we know
everything about her, for the past eight years—and
we know absolutely nothing concerning her before that
time. We do not know where she came from or what
her country is. Have you got that in your mind?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, now refer again to what she told the duke
when he asked her to be his wife.”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“There can be only one explanation of that expression.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
It meant, if it meant anything at all, that once,
before we knew anything about her, she loved a man
who was the cause, directly or indirectly, of her entering
upon a career that brought her to the notice of the
police. It meant that the man is still alive, and that
he might yet offer her his name, and that if he did so,
she would accept it; and that if he failed to do so, she
would never accept any other name. I know that I am
a romantic Frenchman, but that is the way I read that
answer she made to the Duc de Luvois.”</p>

<p>“Very well, chief, I accept your version.”</p>

<p>“Yet you say that she is married.”</p>

<p>“Yes; there is no doubt of it.”</p>

<p>“But you suggest that the man she has married is a
criminal.”</p>

<p>“He is one.”</p>

<p>“Then I do not believe——”</p>

<p>“Wait, chief.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Suppose that the man was not always a criminal?
Suppose that once upon a time he bore a splendid
name, and was in line to succeed to a title? Suppose——”</p>

<p>The chief half started from his chair, then sank
back again into its depths.</p>

<p>“You mean that she has married the only man she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
would give her liberty to—the man to whom she referred
in that talk with the duke?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And that he is now a criminal, and that you are on
his track—and hers?”</p>

<p>“Yes, again.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, Carter, I cannot believe it! Do you know
who she is?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“But you are on the track of finding out?”</p>

<p>“Yes; if you will assist me, chief.”</p>

<p>“You may be sure that I will do that, Carter, to the
extent of my ability; and of everything that this office
can supply. Where is she now? In America?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Carter; before you go more deeply into
this affair I should tell you one thing about the
woman.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Although she has been the cause of many a crime,
and is responsible for the sudden taking off of many
men, although she has filled a large place in our records
for a long time, there is not, to-day, a thing against her
for which she could be arrested, with the least chance
of conviction. It has even been said of her that she
has lived a spotlessly moral life, and so far as my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
knowledge goes, it is the truth. But, she is none the
less a dangerous woman.”</p>

<p>“I know. I have seen her.”</p>

<p>“Ah; then you do know. Why, my friend, she even
tried her wiles upon me—and I nearly fell. It was
chance that saved me, rather than my own good
sense.”</p>

<p>“And you are more than half in love with her yet,
chief. I could see that when you looked at her picture.”</p>

<p>“No; I am not in love with her; not in the least. But
I am fascinated by her. And there is a difference,
Carter.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.
<br />
<small>TRAILED BY FATALITIES.</small></h2>


<p>Although the detective had been in London before
he visited Paris, he had not sought Nan, who was in
that city on the quest he had given her; just now, in
talking with the chief, he half wished that he had done
so.</p>

<p>But he was satisfied that he had not made a mistake
in his conjectures concerning Juno.</p>

<p>She had been a dangerous woman always. According
to the conversation the detective had had with Nan—always
provided that this woman was the same who
had once been Siren—she had begun to scatter danger
around her, even when she was still a child. The peril
of her propinquity had grown greater with the physical
development until now even the chief of the secret
police of Paris acknowledged that he had nearly been
one of her victims.</p>

<p>While the detective was studying the chief, the chief
was contemplating him. It was the latter who spoke
first.</p>

<p>“I wish, Carter, that you would take me more into
your confidence,” he said. “If I was made aware of
precisely what you want, it might be that I could help
you. Or, will you have a look at the <em>dossier</em> first?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“The <em>dossier</em>, please; after that I will try to be quite
frank. But, first—you assure me that this woman has
no criminal record?”</p>

<p>“None that could be designated as such. You will
discover all that when you read the <em>dossier</em>.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell me just why she has made herself so
prominently a figure for the police to study?”</p>

<p>“Ah! That is different. ‘The Leopard’ has been
what you might call ‘a near-criminal’ ever since she
first came to our notice; but she has never been quite
one, that we can ascertain, or prove.”</p>

<p>“I see. Will you tell me how she first attracted the
attention of the police of Paris? That might be interesting.”</p>

<p>“Yes. That was a curious case. There was a certain
Prince Turnieff here in Paris as a diplomatic agent
of the Russian government. We were keeping half an
eye upon the prince, not being quite sure of his status,
and we noticed that he was frequently seen in the company
of a beautiful young woman who was a stranger
to us.”</p>

<p>“And that woman was Juno?”</p>

<p>“Eh? Who?”</p>

<p>“The woman you call ‘The Leopard.’ I know her
by the name of Juno.”</p>

<p>“Ah; an apt name. It fits her. Yes; that woman
was—Juno.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“It was known that the prince was a very rich man
in his own right. Whatever his capacity was here in
representing his government, he lived in regal style,
spent money lavishly, possessed a fortune in jewels
and precious stones, and did what in your country you
would call cutting a wide swath. He was also a handsome
man, young and gifted. Just the sort of a man
that the average woman would admire. See?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly.”</p>

<p>“He lived in a palace in the Faubourg St. Germain,
which he had leased, furnished; he maintained a retinue
of servants and lived like royalty. One day, at
four o’clock in the afternoon, he was found dead in
the library of that palace. There was a bullet hole
in his right temple, and he had died instantly.</p>

<p>“But, Carter, there seemed to be no doubt that he
had killed himself. Everything in the room bore evidence
of that, even to a half-written note that he had
left on the table near where the body was discovered.</p>

<p>“But the last person who was known to have been
with him was the woman you call Juno, and whom I
call ‘The Leopard.’ She was arrested, questioned,
subjected to every art that the French police employ
to force her to tell all she knew of the circumstances,
but we might just as well have left her alone, so far
as any result was obtained from her. She smiled at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
us, defied us, bewitched us, fascinated all of us. That
was the time when I so nearly fell under her spell
myself. She was permitted to go; but ever after that
we felt it our duty to keep her under close surveillance.</p>

<p>“But that is not all of the story, as it relates to
Prince Turnieff.</p>

<p>“I have said that he made a great display of wealth;
that he had in his possession several fortunes in jewels.
I should have added that he did no business at the
banks, and that because of that, it was assumed that
he had brought with him all the cash he required.</p>

<p>“It was estimated that he must have had a million
francs or more in cash in his house at the time of his
death, to say nothing of the jewels. When I tell you
that after his death there was no trace found of either
cash or jewels, and that none of it has ever been seen
since, you will understand how it was that Juno, as
you call her, was suspected.”</p>

<p>The detective nodded.</p>

<p>“Still,” continued the chief, “there was nothing
against the woman. It could not even be established
that she had been other than a friend and a companion
of the rich prince. On that day when he killed
himself—or was presumed to have done so—she had
been with him in his library only a short time, and it
was not until more than two hours after her departure
that the body was discovered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“You wished to know what it was that brought her
first to our attention; that was the circumstance.”</p>

<p>“And the next one? What was that?”</p>

<p>“It happened to be another victim—if I may use
the term. This time it was an Austrian. We did
not know till after his death that he was a spy in the
service of Austria, but that developed later.”</p>

<p>“Did the Austrian also kill himself?”</p>

<p>“No; he was murdered in cold blood. But it happened
more than an hour after he had parted with your
Juno, and there was not a thing to connect her with
the crime, save that she had been with him an hour
previously—and that all his money and valuables had
disappeared at the time of his death. He was killed
while he was the occupant of a closed carriage in
which they had been riding together; the carriage
stopped at the door where she lived to put her down,
and the driver testified that the man was alive after she
left him.</p>

<p>“He was a diplomatic agent, also; and, as in the
other case, it was said that papers of great value, as
well as other things, had disappeared from his person.</p>

<p>“I could give you other incidents of the same sort,
Carter, that have happened in her career. The police
of St. Petersburg could do the same. Vienna, Berlin,
and other centres of activity could each add a quota;
and there you are. Now, I will ask you to read her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
<em>dossier</em>, and after that we will discuss her further, if
you desire it.”</p>

<p>The chief touched a button and gave a direction;
and, presently, with an open volume before him, Nick
withdrew into a corner and passed half an hour in
studying what had been written down in it under the
name of “The Leopard.”</p>

<p>At the end of that time he closed the volume and
drew his chair forward.</p>

<p>“The <em>dossier</em> tells me nothing new,” he said to the
chief. “It gives me no further information than that
already supplied by you, save that it goes into details
rather more particularly.”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“I find that the part which interests me most is in
that sentence already quoted, used by her in her rejection
of the suit of the Duc de Luvois. I believe,
chief, that I can establish the identity of the woman,
through an agent of mine who is now in London. I
think that I can do so, but I am not certain as yet.”</p>

<p>“Then you will accomplish more than all my force
has been able to do, Carter.”</p>

<p>“Through an accident, believe me; not through lack
of zeal, or because of deficient ability on the part of
your men.”</p>

<p>“That’s as it may be. Are you willing to tell me who
you think she is?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“Unless you insist, I would rather keep that to myself
until I am certain.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I cannot blame you for that. Does the
woman know that you are on her track? Does she
suspect that you are searching out her record?”</p>

<p>“She suspects; I do not think she knows.”</p>

<p>“You are positive that she suspects?”</p>

<p>“No; I am not positive; but I suppose she does suspect.
I am morally certain of it.”</p>

<p>“Carter, have you read that <em>dossier</em> very carefully?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Have you taken careful account of the number of
fatalities to others that have followed in her wake
wherever she has gone?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Very well. There is one thing which is not written
down in words upon that record, and it is to that I
now call your attention.”</p>

<p>“What is it, chief?”</p>

<p>“I have said that we have never been able to prove
anything against your Juno. The principle reason for
that is that in every case where it has been supposed
that she could no longer escape us, death by violence,
self-inflicted, or otherwise, has removed the person,
or persons, whose testimony might have convicted her.
Does that statement convey an idea to you, Carter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. You mean to tell me, in that roundabout
fashion, that if Juno suspects that I am on her track
my own life is in danger. Is that it?”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, I am speaking only in generalities;
you may call it superstition if you like; but fatalities
have pursued those who have been inimical to the
peace and liberty of that woman. Whether it is the
result of coincidence or of design, I am not prepared
to say; but if I were on that woman’s trail and had unearthed
anything which could be used against her, and
knew that she suspected it, I would make my will and
all arrangements for a sudden taking off, confidently
expecting that death might overtake me at any moment.”</p>

<p>“You would make Juno out a murderer, chief.”</p>

<p>“I would make her out what she is called, a leopard,
who destroys. Whether she strikes the necessary
blows herself or has them delivered for her—who can
say? If she plots the fatalities and arranges them—who
can tell? If the fiend himself protects her and
drives men mad and makes them kill themselves—who
can determine? The facts remain. Those who are
hostile to that woman die. There you are.”</p>

<p>“I have lived rather a long time, chief, and I am not
dead yet.”</p>

<p>“No; but if that woman suspects that you are on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
her trail with any chance of doing her a permanent injury,
I wouldn’t give a centime for your life; not one.”</p>

<p>The detective shrugged his shoulders and smiled;
but he made no further comment.</p>

<p>Then the chief took the receiver from the telephone
hook, in answer to a call that came in at that moment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.
<br />
<small>THE SIREN EXERTS HER SKILL.</small></h2>


<p>Had the detective known that Juno was in Paris at
that moment he might possibly have paid more attention
to the remarks of the chief of police.</p>

<p>But he was soon to know it.</p>

<p>When the chief took down the telephone, Nick
picked up a paper that was lying on the desk and was
scanning the front page, when an ejaculation from his
companion caused him to turn his head and regard
the man attentively.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he heard the chief say over the phone,
in French, “let nothing throw you off the scent, Mouquin.
Keep me informed. Let me know everything
concerning her with the least possible delay. It is
vitally important, just at this time.”</p>

<p>He replaced the receiver on its hook and turned to
Nick Carter.</p>

<p>“My friend,” he said, “you will admit that perhaps
I am not an unwise prophet. You are here in Paris
on the trail of The Leopard; The Leopard is here in
Paris on your trail. I am so informed by one of my
best men, Mouquin by name. What will you?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me that Juno is in Paris?”
asked Nick, interested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“She has only just left the train at the <em>gare du
nord</em>,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Are you sure that there can be no mistake, chief?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly.”</p>

<p>“And she has entered the city openly? Without any
attempt at disguise?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Why should she disguise herself? There is
nothing for which we can apprehend the woman. She
knows that every footstep she takes while she is here
will be watched. She has known that for a long time.
I think she rather likes it; so why should she not come
here openly?”</p>

<p>“What has brought her here, I wonder?” mused the
detective.</p>

<p>“You have brought her here, my friend,” replied
the chief.</p>

<p>“But, why should she follow me here? I know why
she would like to have me out of the way—dead, if
you will—but——”</p>

<p>“Listen here, Mr. Carter. On the other side of the
water, in your own country, you are something of a
celebrity. Murder is as common there as here, but it
is done differently, as a rule. Believe me, you are a
dangerous man to that woman, and, being dangerous,
she desires to overcome that danger. Very well; there
is no place on earth where she would rather see you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
just now, than here in Paris. In coming here you
have played directly into her hands.”</p>

<p>“Well, admitting that it is so, what then?”</p>

<p>“What then? He asks me, what then? Death,
then, my friend!”</p>

<p>“And you, the chief of the secret police of Paris, sit
here, in your chair, in your own private office, and
tell me that? And you still permit such a woman to
run at large in the streets of your city!”</p>

<p>Nick smiled when he made that remark; smiled
tauntingly.</p>

<p>The chief hunched his shoulders, spread out his
hands, palms upward, screwed his face into an indescribable
expression, and replied:</p>

<p>“What can I do? What could you do, in my position?
Nothing. Nothing at all.”</p>

<p>“I could at least keep the woman under such close
surveillance that she would not make a move that I
did not know about. She would not——”</p>

<p>“Ah! Ah! Ah! Well, I will do that. I have already
given directions to that effect. But I have done
it before, times without number—and it has always
been the same.”</p>

<p>“The same what? Do you mean that she gives you
the slip?”</p>

<p>“I mean that, although my men believe that they
can put their hands upon her at any moment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
day or night, while they watch her, yet—yet the things
that I have attempted to describe, happen.”</p>

<p>“Who is the man who telephoned to you just now,
chief?”</p>

<p>“Louis Mouquin; one of my best men. There is no
better detective in Paris to-day, and not another one
who is as good at shadowing.”</p>

<p>“He has shadowed her before, has he not?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Many times.”</p>

<p>“Then you can rely upon it she is ‘onto his curves,’
all right.”</p>

<p>“She is—what?”</p>

<p>“She knows the man and his methods. No matter
how good he is, he is no good so far as she is concerned.”</p>

<p>“What, then, would you do, Carter? I am quite
willing to take any suggestion from you that you can
make.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then, I will make this one. I’ll take the
job of trailing that woman myself.”</p>

<p>“You, Carter?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“For me? For this department?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; only, if I do that—for you, and not
wholly for myself—you must call off your own men
and leave it all to me alone.”</p>

<p>For the fraction of a moment the chief hesitated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Then a quiet smile stole across his face, and he replied:</p>

<p>“Very well. It shall be done. I appoint you—without
pay; eh?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I am now a special, under your orders;
but there is one other thing I must have, chief.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Authority.”</p>

<p>“Eh? What sort of authority?”</p>

<p>“A written appointment over your signature; a
badge; anything. I don’t care what it is, so long as
it bestows the authority I want and gives me the command
over any of your men whom I may chance to
meet.”</p>

<p>“You shall have that. I will give you the badge
which will place you next in authority to me. That
place happens to be vacant just now. It shall be yours
so long as you remain in Paris. And I will send you
to Mouquin. He will show you to what place——”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, chief, but I would prefer it in another
way.”</p>

<p>“Well? As you please. What, then?”</p>

<p>“I will sit right here until Mouquin telephones to
this office again. When he does so, you will tell him
to bring The Leopard here to you. If she should hesitate
to come——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, she will not do that. She will probably be delighted
to come here.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? Well, I will remain here till she arrives.
I will see her here.”</p>

<p>“And then——”</p>

<p>“Chief, you and I work on different plans and by
different methods; but we work to the same ends.”</p>

<p>“Assuredly.”</p>

<p>“In the case of a person like this woman something
new and entirely original has to be undertaken. There
are circumstances where I think it is best to play
your cards, face up, on the table, and this is one of
them. When she arrives here you will see what I
mean.”</p>

<p>“Do you intend to let her know that you are to take
the trail after her, and that——”</p>

<p>“Exactly, chief. But, wait until she arrives. You
have other business to attend to now. I will amuse
myself with these books here until Mouquin telephones.
After that, he will not be long in bringing
the woman here, will he?”</p>

<p>“No. Very well. As you say, my friend.”</p>

<p>It was an hour later when Mouquin called again and
notified the chief of the street and number to which
Juno had betaken herself; and then he received his
orders to bring her to the private office of the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
without delay. When another half hour had passed
she was ushered into the room.</p>

<p>Nick had felt no doubt that Juno was aware of his
presence in Paris, but he did expect her to manifest
some surprise at finding him in that office in consultation
with the chief of the secret police.</p>

<p>But, quite on the contrary, her eyes sought him at
once after she had greeted the chief, and she turned
to him with a smile and exclaimed, quite as if she had
confidently expected to see him:</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mr. Carter? We meet again, in
a strange place, after our last interview; is it not so?”</p>

<p>“I must confess that I did not expect to find Mrs.
Dinwiddie in Paris so soon,” replied the detective, rising
and stepping toward her. Then, addressing the
chief, he added: “Chief, I wish to present you to
madam by her true name; a name which I fancy you
have not known—Mrs. Dinwiddie, of Virginia.”</p>

<p>She laughed, and with a gayety which did not appear
to be assumed.</p>

<p>“I am a respectable married woman now, chief,”
she said. “I am, indeed, Mrs. Ledger Dinwiddie, of
Virginia, and if you are perhaps wondering why I am
here, or in Paris at all, I will enlighten you without
delay. Mr. Carter, as you doubtless know, is that famous
detective whom all America praises. He is supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
to be exceptionally great in his class, and his
profession has brought about a strange circumstance.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding the great ability of Mr. Carter,
he has committed a grievous error. He has mistaken
my husband for a man who was once a criminal, but
who is now dead. The highest court in the State of
New York has adjudged that criminal to be dead and
accepted the proofs of identity offered by my husband.
Yet Mr. Carter persists in asserting that Ledger
Dinwiddie is that dead criminal. Remarkable, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>The chief did not reply. He preferred not to commit
himself. He waited; but, in the meantime, he devoured
the beauty of the woman with his eyes. It was
quite true that she had brought with her into that
obscure office a radiance, a fascination, and an atmosphere
of influence which affected every person there.</p>

<p>It was not her beauty alone; it was a certain magnetism
which seemed to shed energy around her like the
particles that spring spontaneously from radium.</p>

<p>As no one spoke, she continued:</p>

<p>“Not long ago, Mr. Carter appeared, during an evening,
at my home in Virginia. He did not say that he
was a detective, then; and I did not suspect it till after
he had gone away. I remembered that Mr. Carter
possessed an international reputation, and thought it
not unlikely that he knew something about me, as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
have known me here. I followed him to New York
when he returned there—and then I followed him
here.”</p>

<p>She paused for a moment and turned squarely toward
Nick Carter. Then she spoke directly to him.</p>

<p>“I have followed you here, Mr. Carter, for my own
protection,” she said, using her eyes with all the art she
possessed, and lowering her voice until it purred like
the animal for which the Paris police had named her.
“The chief will tell you that I am not a criminal, and
that there is nothing against me, although many ugly
things have been said about me.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter, I do not want to have all these matters
discussed over there in your country, where I have
married, and am happy, so I have come here after you
to plead with you to spare me. Surely that is not a
great boon to ask at your hands. I ask you now to
come with me to my hotel so that I may tell you the
story of my chequered life—so that I may prevail upon
you to become my champion instead of my traducer.
Will you go there with me?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.
<br />
<small>THE SIREN AT WORK.</small></h2>


<p>“Madam,” said Nick Carter, “let us understand each
other. I came here to trace out the career you have
pursued, not because I expected to make you the victim
of my researches, but because I believed that
through you I would be able to prove the identity of
Bare-Faced Jimmy Duryea. That is the reply to your
request for me to tell you why I am in Paris. I will
add this: My work here is already finished. I have
found the information that I expected to find.” He
looked at his watch. “In three hours from now I shall
leave for London.”</p>

<p>They were seated opposite each other in the parlor
of the suite she had taken on her arrival in the city,
where he had accompanied her from the office of the
chief.</p>

<p>Nick had placed no confidence whatever in her
stated wish to reveal her life history to him, but he
had thought that she might say or do something to
betray herself, or to give him the cue he needed in following
out his plans. So he had accepted her proposal
that he should go with her.</p>

<p>She left her chair and crossed the door toward him.
He arose as she did so and stood facing her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>He knew her to be a dangerous woman; he believed
her to be a treacherous one; he had no doubt that just
now she was a desperate one.</p>

<p>To what ends she might dare to venture in this interview
with him he had no idea, but he was thoroughly
on his guard. That she would dare to attempt
violence of any sort was farthest from his thoughts,
for they had gone there together with the full knowledge
of the chief of police—and that they had been
trailed from the office of the chief Nick did not for a
moment doubt.</p>

<p>But he did expect that she would try her feminine
wiles upon him.</p>

<p>He knew that to be her most effective weapon. He
had heard enough to understand that she did not hesitate
to make use of it when occasion demanded.</p>

<p>There are women in the world who have been gifted
wondrously, and she was the personification of them
all.</p>

<p>The word beautiful does not describe her. She was
alluring. She drew men to her as a charged magnet
draws particles of steel. Once amenable to her influence,
they were apparently as powerless to resist her
as those same bits of steel are helpless under that attraction.</p>

<p>She halted directly in front of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Her eyes, luminously bright, glowed upon him. He
felt the thrill of them. He realized that there was
something more than mere magnetism in that gaze, too.
There was a quality about it that was hypnotic. He
knew that at that moment she was exerting all the latent
powers within her to bring him under the spell
of her charms.</p>

<p>Nick Carter had anticipated something of this sort,
and he was prepared for it.</p>

<p>He had suggested to the chief that there were occasions
when it was well to play one’s cards face up
on the table, and up to this point he had done that
very thing. He had purposely thrust himself in this
woman’s way in order that she might have all the opportunity
she desired to exert her powers of fascination—for
Nick Carter intended all along to appear to
yield to them.</p>

<p>That was the game he had intended, from the moment
her presence in Paris was known to him, to play.
He meant to let her suppose that he was the same
sort of weakling as the others had been, who were inimical
to her interests.</p>

<p>In a word, <em>he meant to appear to become her willing
victim</em>.</p>

<p>He realized that he had an extremely difficult part
to play. He knew what her intelligence was and that
she would be as shrewd as he in every move that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
might make—unless her supreme confidence in her
own powers, so many times successful with others,
should lead her astray.</p>

<p>But egotism, too much self-confidence, is the rock
upon which many a one has foundered. Nick Carter
believed it to be the one which would be the undoing
of this brilliant woman, who had so successfully defied
the police departments of all of Europe, and, figuratively,
snapped her fingers at them.</p>

<p>As she approached him across the floor he arose and
faced her.</p>

<p>When she smiled into his eyes he compelled his own
to glow with an answering fire.</p>

<p>When she reached out one hand toward him, in a
half pathetic, half pleading gesture, he extended both
his own and took it between them and held it there.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes?” he replied.</p>

<p>“You will spare me, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Spare you? From what?”</p>

<p>“From the consequences of the investigation you are
making. See, I throw myself upon your mercy; I
plead with you; I am pleading with you now.”</p>

<p>She held his eyes with her own. Her other hand
reached forward and joined the first one resting upon
both of his. They were standing in the middle of the
room. They were very close together. Juno’s eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
were glowing strangely, and Nick, playing his part,
wondered if, after all, he had not dared too much.</p>

<p>She was alluring. She was fascinating. She had
the power of casting a spell, and already he was cognizant
of the force of it.</p>

<p>Her eyes never left his face. He knew that she was
exerting all the hypnotic power she possessed to subject
him to her will.</p>

<p>He had no doubt that she had cultivated that power
to the utmost for years, under competent teachers, until
she had become a master in its use. The power of
exerting hypnotic influence is an attainment which is
the consequence of study and practice; it is not a gift.
One may learn it just as one may learn to be a doctor,
or a lawyer, or a dentist.</p>

<p>Here, then, was the secret of what this woman had
been able to accomplish in her defiance of authority
and in her undoing of the men who had stood in her
way in the past.</p>

<p>Her weapon had been hypnotism, and with it she
had lured that Russian prince, that Duc de Luvois, that
Austrian, and others to their death.</p>

<p>Slowly that free hand of hers stroked the backs of
his.</p>

<p>Brightly, almost with a suggestion of living fire,
her big eyes burned into his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>He felt a tightening at his throat. There was a
sensation as if a rubber band wound tightly around
his brows; but he controlled himself. He managed to
fix his mind upon the object of his presence there, and
he felt that he could resist her, even unto the end.</p>

<p>Her victims had not suspected this quality in her.
They had been men who had thought that she was succumbing
to them rather than they to her.</p>

<p>He forced his eyes to express all that she wished to
show, or to give out that lack of expression which
would assure her that she was succeeding.</p>

<p>All the while that they stood there, facing each
other, with their hands clasped, she kept on murmuring
to him in a low voice, but uttering words that
would have been meaningless under any other circumstances.</p>

<p>It was the droning of her voice, the soft cadences of
it, that tided in what she had undertaken to do. She
was so accustomed to success, so entirely unfamiliar
with failure, that she could not see that her effort was
failing, and that Nick Carter was just as much the
master of himself now as when he entered the parlor
with her.</p>

<p>In the struggle that Nick had with himself when she
first began to attempt the exertion of her power,
beads of perspiration came out upon his brow. The
effort with his own will brought to his face that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
strained expression which she had expected to see there
as a result of her own influence.</p>

<p>Presently she drew him toward one of the large
armchairs that were in the room. She forced him
gently down upon it, standing before him, holding his
eyes still, and now stroking his forehead with her velvety
touch.</p>

<p>Nick knew then why other men had become her
willing victims.</p>

<p>He realized the depth of the pitfall that had been
spread out for them, and how entirely willing they had
been to cast themselves into it.</p>

<p>He appeared to struggle against her power for a
time, and then he permitted his eyes to close, as if he
were indeed hypnotized—and then he heard a quick
sigh of satisfaction escape her.</p>

<p>She drew away from him. He heard her cross the
room, but he did not dare to peer at her between his
lashes, lest she should be watching and see him do it.</p>

<p>He knew that she sank upon a chair, and rested there
for a time, breathing heavily, as if the effort to which
she had put herself had fatigued her greatly. After a
time, when she seemed entirely to have recovered, she
approached him again.</p>

<p>This time she spoke commandingly, as if she were
ordering some menial to do her will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nicholas Carter!” she said sharply. “Answer me!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied dully.</p>

<p>“You are my slave, are you not? Answer.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I am your slave.”</p>

<p>“You will do my will, as I direct? Answer.”</p>

<p>“I will do your will—as you direct,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Hereafter, when I raise my hand—so—open your
eyes that you may see me now—when I raise my hand,
so, you will lose the power of resisting me. Answer.”</p>

<p>“Hereafter, when you raise your hand, so, I will
lose the power of resisting you,” he repeated in a sing-song
voice.</p>

<p>Again she walked away from him, crossing the
room to one of the windows, and this time, as the detective’s
eyes were open, he could watch her.</p>

<p>He saw her stand there for a time looking out upon
the street, and he heard her murmur broken sentences
to herself.</p>

<p>“To think that this man should also succumb to me!
He seemed too strong, at first. I have overpowered
him. When will it all end.” And more to that effect;
then, with a deep sigh she turned about again and went
to him.</p>

<p>“Nick Carter,” she said, standing in front of him.</p>

<p>“Yes?” he replied.</p>

<p>“I am about to awaken you now. You will forget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
that you have slept. You will remember, only, a belief
that I shall give you now.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You will believe that you have held me tightly in
your arms; that my head has been pillowed upon your
breast; that you have told me of your love for me;
that I have confessed my love for you. You will implicitly
believe all that, when you awaken.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I will believe all that.”</p>

<p>“And, when you are seemingly in your right mind,
you will look your love for me; you will feel it, too,
through all your being—but you will make no effort
to demonstrate it. You will not so much as touch
me with your hands. You will be the slave to my will.
You will love me with all your strength, and you will
believe that I return that love—poor fool. And now,
awake! I command it! Awake, Nick Carter!”</p>

<p>But it was no part of Nick Carter’s policy to wake
up just then. He believed there was more to be
learned if Juno believed him to be in the hypnotic
trance, and he realized that there would never be another
opportunity like the present one for learning
things that he wished to know about. So, instead of
starting fully awake, as she had commanded him to
do, he sprang up only half alive to things about him,
seemingly; and he did the very thing which he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
would compel her to reduce him again, as she would
suppose, to the hypnotic trance.</p>

<p>He seized her in his arms.</p>

<p>For just one instant of time she did not resist him.
Then she jerked herself away, out of his grasp, and he
made no effort to prevent her doing so. He sank
backward upon his chair as if he were again fully
under her influence.</p>

<p>He saw that for a moment she turned her back to
him, and that she seemed to struggle with herself—and
in that instant he recalled the brief interval of
hesitation on her part when he had seized her in his
arms. He thought no more of it then, although there
was to come another time when he would remember
it. But that is another story.</p>

<p>She turned toward him again, and between his eyelids
he could see that she was very pale. She raised
her hands and made passes over him, and he permitted
himself to sink into a state which had every appearance
of being a deep, hypnotic sleep.</p>

<p>Having reduced him, as she supposed, to that utterly
unconscious and helpless state, she crossed again
to the window and looked out. Nick watched her
furtively, suddenly possessed with the idea that she
was expecting somebody.</p>

<p>He saw her start, glance hurriedly toward him, then
hasten from the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick remained quietly where he was, not making a
move, and in a moment she was back again—but not
alone. The identity of the man who accompanied her,
notwithstanding the disguise he wore, was instantly
apparent to the detective.</p>

<p>Jimmy Duryea—Bare-Faced Jimmy—stood just inside
the door beside her; Jimmy, perfectly made up to
represent a man long past middle age, and French, at
that; but, Jimmy, nevertheless. Jimmy was looking
down upon the detective with an ironical smile upon
his lips, and a self-satisfied air that made the detective
long to leap to his feet and seize the fellow.</p>

<p>“Look at him,” said Juno, indicating Nick. “I have
done what you could not do; I captured Nick Carter.
I have made him my slave. I could command him to
start for the far North pole, and he would awake and
start, nor would he turn back.”</p>

<p>“Then for goodness’ sake, Juno, command him to go
and drown himself in the Seine,” was the quick reply.
“The world will be well rid of him—and I will be able
to live in peace. Could you do that, Juno?”</p>

<p>“I could.”</p>

<p>“And would he obey you?”</p>

<p>“He would.”</p>

<p>“Then do it. Do it, and we will go to Havre to-night
and catch the French line steamer that steams
away to-morrow. We will be in New York in six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
days. Do it. Do it. I have been sorry ever since I
arrived that I came here at all. It is too close to old
times. I’m not healthy, or healthful, here. I seem to
feel a string around my neck, and to see a huge knife
falling from above. I am going back, anyhow,
whether you go or not, so do it, Juno; do it.”</p>

<p>For a moment she was silent. Then she replied:</p>

<p>“Go over there and stand near the window, then.
Stand with your back this way. Help me, yourself,
by saying over and over to yourself, ‘Obey! Obey!
Obey! Obey!’ Will you do that, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Go ahead.”</p>

<p>Jimmy crossed to the window, and Nick could see
that she kept her eyes upon him as he did so. Nick
dared to peep between his eyelids toward her, and he
was amazed to see that she had tiptoed half the distance
to the window behind Jimmy, and was making
passes in the air toward the man she had married;
not toward Nick Carter.</p>

<p>In his amazement the detective opened his eyes
wider. He could see that Juno’s whole mental effort
was at that moment concentrated upon Bare-Faced
Jimmy, and he was utterly astounded by it.</p>

<p>But a greater astonishment followed when he saw
Jimmy’s arms suddenly fall limply at his sides, after
which the man turned slowly around on his heels and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
faced Juno, every vestige of expression gone from his
face.</p>

<p>“Come nearer to me, Howard Drummond!” she
commanded him; and he obeyed, drawing nearer to
her, keeping his eyes riveted upon hers. Nick knew
that she had accomplished this control of the man
merely by having induced him to concentrate his mind
upon one thing when she asked him to repeat over
and over again the word, obey. But why had she
done it? Nick was soon to know.</p>

<p>For a moment she sank back against a chair, half
exhausted, but keeping her eyes upon Jimmy. Then
Nick heard her muttering words to herself, and yet
toward Jimmy. They were:</p>

<p>“You had the thought; fulfill it. You spoke of the
Seine; go there. You talked of drowning; drown
yourself.”</p>

<p>Suddenly she wheeled toward the detective, who
managed to close his eyes again before she discovered
that they had been unclosed.</p>

<p>“And you, Nick Carter,” she said, half fiercely, “go
with him. Jump into the river with him. Seize him
in your arms and hold him so that neither of you can
unclasp from that embrace. Leap into the river together;
drown together. Go, go, go, go! I will be
well rid of both of you!”</p>

<p>Nick was so amazed by the turn that affairs had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
taken that he did not move, although Jimmy turned
obediently toward the door. She cried out at him
again, “Go, go, go!” and he pretended to obey.</p>

<p>He started to his feet and moved toward the door
after Jimmy, who was already passing the threshold.
Juno darted after Nick, seized him, held him for an
instant, pulled his head partly around, and whispered
another command into his ear.</p>

<p>“Jump into the river with him, but do not drown
yourself,” she commanded in a whisper. “See to it
that he dies beneath the water, but save yourself. Save
yourself, Nick Carter, and then—return here to me.
I have other work for you. Obey me.”</p>

<p>She thrust him through the now open doorway. She
closed the door upon him. Jimmy, under her influence,
was already halfway to the street. For a moment
the detective hesitated. Then, realizing that she
had ordered him to return there, he followed slowly
after Jimmy, not doubting that he would find Juno
when he did choose to return, and realizing that he
must keep this other man from throwing himself into
the river Seine.</p>

<p>The hour was late in the afternoon. Darkness was
falling.</p>

<p>They passed up the street and Nick seized Jimmy
by one arm and guided him around the first corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
they came to—and there, as he had half suspected
would be the case, he encountered the detective, Mouquin,
who had taken Juno to the office of the chief.
Mouquin had been sent after Nick to keep watch over
him, for the chief of the secret police of Paris feared
“The Leopard.”</p>

<p>“Mouquin,” said the detective sternly, “you know
that I am temporarily in authority over you. Here is
the badge of authority given to me by the chief. Here,
also, is some money; sufficient for your needs. Now,
listen to my orders, and obey them, literally.”</p>

<p>“At your service,” was the calm reply.</p>

<p>“This man here”—Nick had seized Jimmy by the
arm and was holding him—“is under a hypnotic
trance, or spell. He has been ordered to jump into the
Seine, but you must lead him to the river Thames,
instead; to London. All rivers will be the same to him,
and that one will do as well as another. Speak soothingly
to him; tell him that you are taking him to the
Seine, and he will go with you quietly enough. Wait
for me in London at Gray’s hotel, in Dover Street. I
may be there as soon as you are.”</p>

<p>“Am I to put him into the river? Did you mean
that?” asked Mouquin.</p>

<p>“No. Wait for me at Gray’s. Go, now. If you
have to address the man by name, call him Jimmy.
Can you pronounce it? Good. Go, now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick stood there and watched Mouquin and his
charge until they were out of sight. After that—and
there had been a lapse of a quarter of an hour—he
hurried back again to the house and the room where he
had parted with Juno.</p>

<p>But Juno was no longer there; instead, upon the
centre table, where it instantly caught his eye, was a
written message which she had left there for him. He
could not repress a smile as he read it. It was——</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Nick Carter</span>: Immersion in the water will restore
you to full consciousness. I have willed it so,
only consciousness will not return soon enough for you
to save the life of Howard Drummond, alias Bare-Faced
Jimmy, and many other names. He will have
drowned before you can save him. I have willed it so,
and I am an expert pupil of the master who taught me.
But I have spared your life; perhaps some day you
may remember it and spare me. Possibly I have been
foolish; I do not know as to that.</p>

<p>“I could not send you to your death. But what I
could do, and did do, was to use you, and him, as a
means for my own escape. This will afford me the
only hour I have ever enjoyed in the city of Paris
when I have been free from surveillance. I shall make
use of the time to disappear, so that even the chief
cannot find me. If you care to do me a favor, in return
for what I have spared you, forget me, and do not
seek me. You may make use of this letter wherever it
will do you the most good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell that judge in New York, and others, that the
real Ledger Dinwiddie died a natural death in a cottage
called ‘The Willows,’ at Palmetto Peach, in
Florida, and is buried in the churchyard of the village
of Tyrone, under the name of John Brown; that the
man who represented himself as Ledger Dinwiddie is
really the James Duryea you claimed he was—Bare-Faced
Jimmy, etc.; that I assisted in the plot by which
Jimmy passed himself off as Dinwiddie; that sufficient
proof of all this is buried in a cigar box behind the
small headstone of that grave, where I placed it, secretly.</p>

<p>“I sign myself, for the sake of this message,</p>

<p>
“<span class="smcap">Juno Dinwiddie</span>.”<br />
</p></div>

<p>The detective caught the same boat from Calais to
Dover that Mouquin had taken with his charge, and he
rode up to London with them; but before leaving Paris
he called again upon the chief of the secret police and
showed him the letter that Juno had written.</p>

<p>“Let her go,” said the chief. “She will not remain
in Paris, and what she does elsewhere I do not care.
She was more considerate of you than she has been
of others, Carter. Beware of her if you come in contact
with her again.”</p>

<p>At Gray’s hotel, in London, Nick found Nan Nightingale
awaiting him.</p>

<p>“You were right, Mr. Carter,” she told him, when
they met. “The girl, Sarah, who was called Siren, did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
not die. I have proof of it here. She became a diplomatic
spy, and has served many governments as such.
Her reputation is not savory, but there is nothing said
against her personal purity. Throughout Europe she
is known by a name that was bestowed upon her by
the French police—‘The Leopard.’ She is the Juno
who married Jimmy; and Jimmy—you know who he
is.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I know now,” was the reply.</p>

<p>Jimmy had, in fact, proven entirely practicable, and
continued to do so as long as he was assured that he
was being taken to the Seine. In that belief he took
passage with Nick Carter for New York; arrived there
in due time and was permitted to plunge head foremost
into the swimming pool of a Turkish bath. He came
out of it, presently, clothed in his right mind, with the
spell of hypnotism gone from him, entirely.</p>

<p>If there was ever a madder man in the United
States than Bare-Faced Jimmy, when he discovered all
that had happened to him since that moment in the
parlor with Juno when he was cast under the spell
she imposed upon him, Nick Carter has never succeeded
in finding him.</p>

<p>He was taken from that Turkish-bath plunge
straight to the Tombs; and this time there was no difficulty
in proving him to be the real Bare-Faced Jimmy,
for in addition to the proof that Nick was able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
produce, Chick and Patsy had found sufficient evidence
that James Duryea did not die, and, therefore,
was not buried, on the island in the Sound.</p>

<p>Nan Nightingale did not return to America at once.</p>

<p>Acting upon the advice of Nick Carter, she went
into Hertfordshire, England, determined to make
peace, if possible, with certain relatives who still lived
there. And Nick Carter returned at once to New
York.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.
<br />
<small>A SECRET MISSION.</small></h2>


<p>It was not long after the detective’s return from
abroad that Joseph, his major domo, ushered a stranger
into the library, bowed to him, and said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter is engaged for the moment, sir, but he
will be at liberty presently. I will tell him that you
have arrived.”</p>

<p>The stranger nodded his head and stood like a
wooden image until Joseph had left the room. Then
his tall and soldierly figure relapsed upon a chair, and
he stared across the room at nothing during the entire
interval of waiting.</p>

<p>Above stairs in the study when Joseph presented
himself there, with the card of the stranger, Nick
Carter received it, glanced at it, nodded to Joseph, who
passed from the room again, then turned to Chick,
who was near the window, and said:</p>

<p>“Go down to the library, Chick. Look the fellow
over for me. Tell him that I’ll be down presently.
Then come back here and tell me what you think of
him.”</p>

<p>Chick left the study in obedience to this direction,
and the moment he was gone the detective picked up
an opened letter that was on the desk in front of him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and read it once more, from beginning to end. It was
typewritten, on a letter head of the Russian embassy, in
Washington, and after the usual superscription, it
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I hope you will regard this letter in the light of a
personal matter, not intended to be at all official in
its character. When it is possible to enjoy a personal
interview with you, I will explain fully that point, and
all the others that are connected with this affair.
I have not had the honor to make your acquaintance,
but I need only say to you that it is a mutual friend of
ours who has induced me to make a demand upon your
services, and that I do so acting solely upon his advice.</p>

<p>“And of your services in a matter of extreme delicacy,
I stand greatly in need, so I beg that you will
come to Washington—since it is utterly impossible as
well as impolitic for me to go to you—as soon as you
can make it convenient to do so. The direct purpose
of this letter is to prepare you for the reception of a
gentleman of my staff whom I have sent to you with
credentials, and who will explain, in part, the dilemma
in which I have unfortunately become involved. Please
understand that I make no charge against the gentleman
mentioned, but his position and his relations with
me and with my household have been such that I
would be glad if you take this opportunity of studying
him somewhat.</p>

<p>“I have the honor to remain, my dear sir,</p>

<p>“Your most obedient and humble”—etc., etc., etc.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>The letter was signed by the ambassador in person.
It had arrived at Nick Carter’s house during the afternoon
of the preceding day. It was now approaching
eleven o’clock in the forenoon of the first day in June.</p>

<p>Nick Carter, during his varied career, had had more
or less experience with matters diplomatic, and was
accustomed to the somewhat stilted phrases and mannerisms
which all ambassadors and ministers regard
it as necessary to employ; but it was unusual that an
ambassador should so far commit himself as to make
a covert charge against one of his own household.</p>

<p>For the detective could read the letter in no other
way than that the gentleman—he had been so described—now
waiting in the library to see him was
under suspicion.</p>

<p>But suspicion of what?</p>

<p>Nick Carter had no idea as to that. Something had
gone wrong with the Russian ambassador, which required
the services of an expert investigator, and for
some reason not given, it had not been deemed advisable
to call in the services of the regular Secret
Service of the United States Government.</p>

<p>Somebody as yet unknown to the detective, but
doubtless a person high in authority in Washington,
had recommended Nick Carter to the ambassador;
hence the letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Chick returned while the detective was turning these
things over in his mind, and he raised his eyes expectantly
when his first assistant entered the room.</p>

<p>“There is nothing remarkable, or even interesting,
about the chap that I can discover,” said Chick, in reply
to the interrogative glance. “He is just a plain,
common type of the Russian army officer who has
been appointed military attaché to this country through
influence at court. He is less than thirty years old and
more than six feet tall. I should say that he is not
overburdened with brains.</p>

<p>“He belongs to the type that gets into no end of
trouble through ignorance, stupidity, pride, arrogance,
and all that sort of thing, but does not seem malicious
at all. He is fair-headed, blue-eyed, rather good-looking—some
women would call him handsome—and all
in all, is rather a likable chap, I imagine. He ranks
as colonel in the Russian army, and the card he sent
up to you is not his own, which fact he took pains to
explain the minute I entered the library where he is
waiting.”</p>

<p>“This card is not his own?” said Nick, picking it
up and glancing at it again. He had barely noticed it
when Joseph gave it to him.</p>

<p>“No. His name is——”</p>

<p>“Why did he send me a card not his own?”</p>

<p>“He said it was done by mistake, and that he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
not discover it until Joseph had left the room to take
it to you. I think he told the truth about that. He
spoke as if it were the truth.”</p>

<p>“Very likely. The name on this card means nothing
at all to me—or to him probably. No name was mentioned
in the letter from the ambassador. What is his
name?”</p>

<p>“He is Colonel Alexis Turnieff.”</p>

<p>“Turnieff? Turnieff? Now, where have I——Oh!
I know. I say, Chick, that is rather an odd circumstance.
Turnieff, eh? And Alexis Turnieff, at that.
You say he is not more than thirty years old?”</p>

<p>“Rather less than that, I should say.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Oh, well, I don’t suppose the name has
any significance in this matter, but it is rather a strange
coincidence, just the same, that it should recur just at
this time.”</p>

<p>“Then the name does mean something to you?”
asked Chick.</p>

<p>“No; not really. It recalled my last trip to the other
side, that is all. It is the name of one of the supposed
victims—the first one that was known about, if
I remember correctly—of Juno, otherwise ‘The
Leopard’.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t likely that Juno has anything to do with
this matter, is it?” Chick asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“No. It isn’t likely, I suppose. But the affair is
Russian. Anyway, I haven’t the least notion what it
is all about. The name struck me, that is all. Well,
I will go down and see Colonel Turnieff. Wait here
till I return.”</p>

<p>The detective left the room and presently entered the
library, where the Russian official rose from the chair
to greet him.</p>

<p>“Prince Alexis Turnieff, I believe?” said the detective,
as he advanced toward his caller. He made
the remark quite naturally, putting it in the form of a
question. He spoke as if he had always known the
man, and had always been fully aware that he was a
Russian prince.</p>

<p>“Yes. I am Prince Alexis Turnieff; but I was not
aware that I mentioned my title to the person who was
just here with me, sir.”</p>

<p>“The person to whom you refer, prince, was Mr.
Chickering Carter, my first and chief assistant. He
is not a servant, as your words might imply was your
belief.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Mr. Carter. I had no intention
to give offense.”</p>

<p>“None is taken, prince. None at all.”</p>

<p>“Would you do me the favor, Mr. Carter, to call
me colonel instead of prince?” the Russian asked, while
another flush rose to his cheeks and forehead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“Certainly, sir; the more readily, because in this
country there are no hereditary titles.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell me, please, how you knew me to be
Prince Alexis Turnieff?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.” This was precisely the point at which
the detective had wished to arrive. “My assistant informed
me that you sent up the wrong card by mistake.
Also that your name is Alexis Turnieff, and that you
are a colonel in the Russian army. Just now, I assume
you to be in the diplomatic service attached to
the Russian embassy. That is correct, is it not?”</p>

<p>“Quite so.”</p>

<p>“Very well; I am more or less familiar with many
Russian names and titles. Not so very long ago I
knew of a gentleman by your name, who was also a
prince. He would be old enough to be your father, if
he were living. I assumed that he was your father,
and being aware that he is dead, I also assumed that
you had succeeded to his title. So”—with a smile—“you
will observe that it was not strange that I should
make use of the title in addressing you.”</p>

<p>“I quite understand. Thank you.”</p>

<p>“And now, colonel, if you are ready we will come to
the business of your call upon me,” said the detective.</p>

<p>“At once. Yes, sir. You have doubtless been informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
that I am here at the request of the ambassador
for the czar, but that my errand is unofficial,
and——”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, colonel; my information is solely to
the effect that a gentleman from the Russian embassy
would call upon me,” said Nick.</p>

<p>Colonel Turnieff fidgeted for a moment in his chair.
Then with some abruptness he said:</p>

<p>“Will you pardon me, Mr. Carter, if I mention another
subject first? I wish to do so because our conversation,
since you entered the room, has suggested
that what I wish now to speak about may have some
bearing upon my errand here to-day.”</p>

<p>“Speak as you please, Colonel Turnieff,” replied
Nick. “I will tell you that I don’t know a thing about
your errand here. I have been instructed that a gentleman
would call upon me, sent here by the Russian
ambassador; farther than that my information does
not extend. If you were to talk about the North Pole,
or the South Pole, it would be all the same to me—save
only that I would like to get at the real purpose
of your visit as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I was about to refer again to my father.”</p>

<p>“Yes? Well?”</p>

<p>“Did you, perhaps, know him personally?”</p>

<p>“No. I never met him or saw him. All that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
know about him refers to his unfortunate death, in
Paris, some time ago.”</p>

<p>“Do you know any of the particulars in relation to
his—death?”</p>

<p>“Only such as were related to me by the chief of the
secret police of Paris, when I was in that city on quite
another matter. The subject of your father came up
between us, and it was mentioned; that is all.”</p>

<p>“You were told that he—that he killed himself?”</p>

<p>“If it is a painful subject to you, colonel, why continue
it? Yes, I was so informed.”</p>

<p>“Were you also informed of the circumstances associated
with his death?” the Russian persisted.</p>

<p>“Yes. Of some of them, at least. I did not go into
the subject definitely. It was not of especial interest
to me at the time.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell me what was told to you?”</p>

<p>“Really, colonel——”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, sir, I know that this seems entirely beside
the subject of my call here, but possibly it may
not appear so later on. If you will be patient with me,
I will be your debtor.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell me what was told to you in regard
to the death of my father?”</p>

<p>The detective hesitated. What had been told to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
was, in a way, a privileged communication imparted
in confidence. Presently he replied:</p>

<p>“I will tell you as much about it as I think I may
with discretion. The main points of my information
are these: Your father, Prince Turnieff, was sent to
Paris on a secret mission of some sort for his government.
He took there with him a very large sum of
money presumably his own. Also while there he made
a great display of valuable jewels, though why he did
so does not appear.”</p>

<p>“Your information is entirely correct so far, Mr.
Carter. I will add to it in that particular. He had
with him the equivalent of two hundred thousand
dollars in cash in your money. He also had in his
possession at that time certain jewels which were the
property—or had been—of a family that had suffered
exile. Those jewels had been forfeited to the crown
together with other possessions, and——”</p>

<p>“My dear sir, what has all this to do with our matters?”</p>

<p>“Bear with me a moment, please.”</p>

<p>“Go on, then.”</p>

<p>“The jewels which my father displayed with seeming
recklessness were of very great value—they were
worth another sum equal to the amount he had with
him in cash. My father was not a person given to
needless display, and so you may assume that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
was a definite purpose in his conduct in making a display
of them, and in his reckless expenditure of money
also. All that formed a part of his mission there.”</p>

<p>“I understand you. Well?”</p>

<p>“Now, will you tell me what more you heard about
his death?”</p>

<p>“No. I will not say any more on the subject now.”</p>

<p>“Then I will tell you—for I perceive that you hesitate
only to spare my feelings, and I honor you for it.
While in Paris, he was very much in the company
of a woman who had at that time, and has since had,
many names. To the police she was known as ‘The
Leopard.’ Am I correct?”</p>

<p>“Quite so.”</p>

<p>“My father made his home in a palace which he had
taken, furnished, in the Faubourg St. Germain. He was
found dead in the library of that palace one afternoon,
with a bullet hole in his brain. There was a pistol
beside him, and a partly written note on the
table near him, telling that he had decided to kill himself.
The last person who was in his company before
that happened was ‘The Leopard,’ the beautiful
young woman in whose company he had been seen so
often.</p>

<p>“But she had been gone from the house a long time
before the shooting was supposed to have taken place,
and although she was taken to the prefecture of police<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and closely questioned, not a thing could be determined
against her. Is that substantially what was
told to you by the chief, Mr. Carter?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Did he inform you also that not one centime of the
money, and not one trace of the jewels, could be
found after the death of my father?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. That is all I care to ask you about the
circumstance at the present moment; but I wish to
add to it one statement of my own.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“My father went to Paris on a secret mission in
which there was almost no hope of success; a secret
mission in which his life was at stake from the moment
he departed from St. Petersburg. The display
of the jewels was a necessary part of his enterprise.
The possession of a great sum of money, and the lavish
expenditure of that money, was another necessary part
of it. The woman known as ‘The Leopard,’ was supposed
at that time to be also in the service of Russia,
but it has been thought—not determined, mind you,
but only suspected—since then, that she was all the
while in the actual service of another government. It
was because she was ostensibly in the service of Russia,
that she was seen so much with my father. That
was another definite part of the enterprise.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“I understand.”</p>

<p>“My own opinion—and it is only an opinion, not
knowledge—is that she was all the time working
against my father in Paris. If she did not actually
murder him, she was nevertheless the direct cause of
his death. Well, sir, now I come to the point toward
which this conversation has tended.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“That woman—‘The Leopard’—is now in the city
of Washington. She lives there openly, supposedly the
possessor of a large fortune. She occupies a large
house in one of the fashionable streets of the capital
where she entertains lavishly. She is a woman of
most remarkable beauty and attractiveness. She is a
creature of many fascinations. All who go near her
fall under the spell she casts about her.”</p>

<p>“You surprise me, colonel,” said the detective. And
indeed it was so. Nick Carter was surprised that
Juno had ventured to return to the United States so
soon. “But assuredly she does not call herself ‘The
Leopard,’ in Washington society, does she?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed. She is now the Countess Juno Narnine—Countess
Narnine—and Narnine happens to be
the name of one of the branches of my own family. I
can positively assure you that she is in no manner related
to them, notwithstanding the fact that this woman
has succeeded in establishing herself beyond question;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and supplied credentials which cannot be denied. Now,
sir, I will get down to the purpose of my visit here.”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment. Why have you chosen to tell
me about this countess? We will call her so, since she
has succeeded in establishing her right to use the
name.”</p>

<p>“Because she has something to do with the purpose
of my call upon you—I think.”</p>

<p>“Oh. You think so. You are not sure of it, then?”</p>

<p>“Nobody has ever been sure of anything connected
with that woman, sir.”</p>

<p>“I see. You regard her much as the chief over in
Paris did.”</p>

<p>“I am not informed concerning his regard for her,
nor as to what his estimate of her character may have
been; but speaking for myself, I can say that she is
at once the most compelling creature, the most attractive
woman, the most fascinating personality, and
the most beautiful human creation that God ever put
into the world. At the same time she is the most
dangerous. All the objections to her are summed up
in that one word dangerous, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“One more question, colonel.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“If I had not addressed you as prince, and hence,
had not called up the unpleasant recollections of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
father, would you have mentioned this woman in connection
with the matter that sent you to me?”</p>

<p>“I should have mentioned her, but not in the manner
I have now chosen. Her name would have been mentioned,
but not in just the way I have done it.”</p>

<p>“Would you have told me this story about your
father, and his relations with her, if the subject had
not been brought about in the manner it was?”</p>

<p>“No. I should not have done that—now.”</p>

<p>“But later you might have done so?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Later I am certain that I would have done
so.”</p>

<p>“Why? I would like to know that before we proceed.
You see you are somewhat ambiguous, Colonel
Turnieff.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I can explain why, unless it
arises from the natural inclination to clear up the
mystery of my father’s death. That is human—and
filial—isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Decidedly.”</p>

<p>“Now, shall we get at the object of my mission here
to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“May I ask you, first, if you are at all familiar with
the methods employed in diplomatic affairs, where
the thing to be done is a secret one and bears no direct
relations to the official duties of an ambassador?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your question is somewhat involved. I will reply
to it generally. Yes; I know that a representative of
royalty, no matter where stationed, is supposed to take
his orders without question, and to execute them literally,
no matter what the consequences, or what means
it may be necessary to employ.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir. My chief, whom I now represent
unofficially, has been engaged upon an affair of great
delicacy for his royal master. Concerned in that affair
are papers of the vastest importance imaginable—of
such supreme value that their loss cannot be estimated
in words or in figures. Mr. Carter, one-half of those
papers have disappeared absolutely. They must be recovered
at any cost. In the meantime the remaining
half of them must be safeguarded so thoroughly that
there can be no chance that they will follow after the
others.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.
<br />
<small>THE WORK OF A SECRET AGENT.</small></h2>


<p>“It seems to be your pleasure to speak in enigmas,
colonel,” said the detective.</p>

<p>“In enigmas? How so, sir?” was the reply.</p>

<p>“You speak of certain important papers which are
of untold value, and announce that one-half of those
papers have disappeared; as if the papers were a melon,
or an apple that one might cut into two parts—dividing
them equally. Be good enough to explain what
you mean.”</p>

<p>“Ah; I made the announcement just as it came to
me; but I did not intend to puzzle you, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it will be the pleasure of the ambassador,
when you talk with him, to explain to you exactly
what those papers are; but I have not permission to do
so. In fact I am not entirely informed upon the subject
myself. I know only so much about them as it
was necessary for me to know, to carry out my part
of the work.”</p>

<p>“I understand.”</p>

<p>“Let me endeavor to explain in this way: His majesty,
the czar, is interested in accomplishing a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
purpose that is well defined in his own mind, and
in the minds of his counselors, which relates to another
government—not the United States. You understand
that, Mr. Carter?”</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“I was instructed to assure you that you would not
be asked to do anything that you could not conscientiously
perform as a loyal citizen of the United States.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Go on.”</p>

<p>“The ambassador whom I represent was directed
to carry on the secret work of that affair, and to direct
it from his embassy, in Washington. He has done
so. In carrying on the work a mass of documents
has collected. They are entirely apart from his regular
official duties as ambassador to the United States.”</p>

<p>“I already understand that, sir.”</p>

<p>“Among those documents which have collected, there
are certain papers which, if placed upon this table in
one package, might be contained in a rubber band, and
might be deposited within the space contained in your
greatcoat pocket. As I have stated, those documents—those
to which I am referring just now—are of vast
importance.”</p>

<p>“I think I am sufficiently well assured of that,
colonel.”</p>

<p>“As a means of safety, these papers were not only
written in cipher, but they were then redrawn, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
halves, and the originals were destroyed. They were
drawn up and written in such a manner that neither
half of them could be deciphered without the other
half. Do you follow me?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly.”</p>

<p>“Those two halves, each necessary to the other half,
were concealed, hidden away for safe-keeping, by the
ambassador in person, in places known only to himself
supposedly; in localities widely different. Understand
that they were not yet complete, or they would
have been forwarded to St. Petersburg before now.
That is what was to be done with them as soon as they
were completed.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“They would, each half by itself, have been sent to
St. Petersburg—and by entirely different routes. For
example, I might have been dispatched there with one-half
of them in my charge, ignorant of what I carried
with me, save only that they were documents of importance
to be delivered exactly as directed.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I might have been sent with them by way of China;
the other half might have been sent direct by another
person. Each of us would have known nothing of the
other one. Understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But what has that to do with their disappearance?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am merely endeavoring to impress upon you the
care with which they were guarded, and would have
been guarded to the end.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I understand that.”</p>

<p>“The documents were nearly complete, but not quite
so. There remained one matter of importance to be
accomplished, before the documents were forwarded,
as I have described, to St. Petersburg.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, one of the halves of those prepared documents
has disappeared from the place where the package
was concealed. The ambassador instructed me to
tell you that, so far as he is aware, no person other
than himself knew where either of those packages
was concealed. He wishes to have you go to Washington,
to consult with him on the matter without delay,
and he desires to impose entire secrecy concerning
the affair upon you.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?”</p>

<p>“That, Mr. Carter, is the purport of my mission
here. I was to tell you that much. I could not tell
you more than that, for the reason that my own knowledge
goes no farther. Whatever else there is to be
told to you, the ambassador will tell you in person.”</p>

<p>“You have no idea where the papers were concealed,
colonel?”</p>

<p>“Beyond the surmise that they were somewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
within the embassy, I have not even an idea concerning
them; and even that much is only a surmise.”</p>

<p>“Colonel Alexis Turnieff, in a matter of this kind,
one has to ask plain questions—so plain that they are
sometimes offensive,” said the detective, fixing his
eyes upon the face of the man before him.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I can understand the necessity for that.
I am not thin-skinned, Mr. Carter. If your statement
in any manner applies to me, I will say that you are at
liberty to put any questions to me that occur to you.
But I must assure you again that I have absolutely no
knowledge as to the contents of those papers.”</p>

<p>“But you do know that name of the government,
other than the Russian government, that they concerned;
eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes; although I am not at liberty to tell you that.
The ambassador——”</p>

<p>“I don’t care to know it at the present time. What
I do want to know—and this is one of the questions
which might be offensive; particularly if you are entirely
loyal to your chief—is this: Could the ambassador
serve his own purposes, personal or otherwise,
by making it appear that those papers had disappeared
when in reality they had not done so?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean, would he steal them himself?” demanded
Turnieff, in amazement.</p>

<p>“Words to that effect; yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“Impossible!”</p>

<p>“Now, if you had discovered where one of those
packages was concealed—in making use of the pronoun,
I refer not alone to yourself in person, but to every
other member of the official household of the ambassador—would
it have advantaged you or any other
person within that household to have abstracted one
of those packages?”</p>

<p>“I cannot conceive how it would have done so, Mr.
Carter.”</p>

<p>“I do not mean that papers so taken would necessarily
be used, or passed on to other persons; but
would it have been to the interest of any person of
your knowledge to repress those papers?”</p>

<p>“The question, Mr. Carter, is beyond me. Remember,
I am utterly ignorant of their contents.”</p>

<p>“But knowing the country besides your own that they
concern, you, being in the diplomatic service, could
make a shrewd guess regarding the purport of them,
could you not?”</p>

<p>“No. Really, Mr. Carter, I could not. I have known
enough about what has been going on, to have drawn
conclusions several times; conclusions which I thought
at the time were quite satisfactory, but which inevitably
have proven to be entirely and utterly erroneous.”</p>

<p>“How long a time have those papers been in preparation?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“I do not know.”</p>

<p>“How long a time have you been attached to the
embassy at Washington?”</p>

<p>“Two years; rather more than that.”</p>

<p>“They have been in preparation since you have been
there?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And before that time?”</p>

<p>“I have reason to suppose so.”</p>

<p>“Who would be chiefly interested in stealing papers
of the sort you suppose them to be, colonel?”</p>

<p>“Ah; now you ask me a question which I can answer.
Not directly; I don’t mean that; but in a general
way.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I am only young in the service, Mr. Carter, but I
have been sufficiently long engaged in it to know that
whenever there is a diplomatic movement on foot, inimical
to another country or government, the government
which it threatens is pretty apt to have an inkling
of the matter, or at least a suspicion.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I should suppose so.”</p>

<p>“We will say, then, that this affair threatens the
government of Siam—which is preposterous, of course;
I suggest it only by way of illustration.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“If the government of Siam were one of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
or second rate powers, it would have diplomatic representatives
at every capital in the world. It would
have secret agents all over the world. You understand
that?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Now, if it suspected that Russia was plotting some
antagonistic move, it would watch Russia, not alone at
St. Petersburg, but all over the world. It would consider
carefully who the man might be in the diplomatic
service of Russia, who would be most likely to be
given the operation of such a delicate affair, and who
could be entirely trusted with it; who possessed the
brain capacity to carry it out; who was in every way
competent.”</p>

<p>“I understand you. Well?”</p>

<p>“Suppose that in such a case Siam decided that the
ambassador to the United States was that man. Siam
would at once dispatch a horde of secret agents to this
country. Some of them would be Siamese, but the
majority of them would be of other nationalities.
They would belong to that class which become international
spies through choice, and have little care what
governments they serve; who go from the service of
one to the service of another as readily as you or I
would change our clothing.”</p>

<p>“And it is your opinion, then, that Siam—we will
keep up the fiction for the moment—has many secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
agents in Washington now, and that one of them has
managed to get his hands on those papers.”</p>

<p>“Or her hands; yes. That is the idea.”</p>

<p>“I understand you. Now—could one of those secret
agents for the other power, by any possibility, become
a member of the official family of your ambassador?”</p>

<p>“Why not, Mr. Carter?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.
<br />
<small>THE AMBASSADOR’S CABINET.</small></h2>


<p>Nick Carter was seated in the private cabinet at
the embassy, facing the ambassador.</p>

<p>He had just been conducted to that room, and the
ambassador, a tall, stately gentleman of the inscrutable
school, every inch the representative of his czar,
was still standing beside his desk, with one hand resting
upon it, while he bent a little forward toward the
detective, devouring him with his piercing eyes.</p>

<p>And they were eyes which had been accustomed for
years to read the characters of men of all nationalities,
and of every walk in life.</p>

<p>Nick Carter felt at once that this tall gentleman was
a power within himself, and that nothing short of an
explosion of dynamite at his feet could move him out
of his habitual calm.</p>

<p>“I have heard very satisfactory things about you,
Mr. Carter, if you will pardon me for using that expression,”
the ambassador said slowly, picking his
words, and still keeping his keen eyes upon the detective,
while he retained that same attitude beside the
desk. “I will not hesitate to say that the statements
were made by no less a person than the present incumbent
of the White House.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indeed?” replied the detective. “That is gratifying.”</p>

<p>“Do not misunderstand me, Mr. Carter. He was
not aware that I needed the services of a gentleman
of your qualifications. Nobody has been made aware
of that, save the man who went to New York to induce
you to come here—and myself.”</p>

<p>The detective bowed his head. He made no other
reply.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are more or less well known in Washington?”
the ambassador asked; and he passed around
the desk to his chair.</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“I apprehended that your personality is, also, more
or less well known; and by that I refer also to your
profession?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” Nick replied again.</p>

<p>“That is why I made the appointment with you for
this hour—midnight. I desired that as few persons as
possible should know of your visit to this house.”</p>

<p>“In that case, prince,” replied the detective, smiling,
“you should have made the appointment at noonday,
instead of at midnight. One is less noticeable, if one
arrives among others, than if one goes by oneself to
a place of appointment. The best place to hold a secret
conference is in the midst of a crowd; at least that has
been my experience.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>The prince—for he was one, although his title was
rarely used in Washington—shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“After all,” he said, “the matter of the secrecy of
your present employment is one that is entirely your
own affair. I assume that if you are competent to
take this matter in hand for me you are also perfectly
capable of guarding the minor details connected with
it.”</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“This city at the present time is filled with secret
agents of another government than mine or yours—and
those secret agents have been chiefly interested
in watching me for a long time. I have no doubt that
your presence here at the embassy is already known to
them.”</p>

<p>“More than likely it is.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, Mr. Carter, it might be inferred that
you have come here to see me on matters entirely your
own; or at least not mine. It is quite as logical that
you should represent one government as another.”</p>

<p>“Yes; or none at all, prince.”</p>

<p>“True.”</p>

<p>“Before we go into the particulars of my visit here,
prince, I would like you to tell me the name of that
government whose spies swarm in the city at the present
time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall not permit you to work in the dark, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Carter. I have had no such intention, for that would
thwart the very purpose of your employment.”</p>

<p>The ambassador bent forward, selected a piece of paper
and a pencil, wrote something on the paper, passed
it over to the detective, and said:</p>

<p>“That is the name of the government whose spies
are chiefly interested in the subject which we will
presently discuss, Mr. Carter; but, if you please, we
will not mention it to each other, even in a whisper or
by so much as an innuendo.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p>“Walls have ears, you know; and sometimes eyes as
well.”</p>

<p>“I know. While I was talking with Colonel Turnieff,
he had occasion to draw a simile, and he made use
of the name of Siam. Suppose in referring to this
country, the name of which you have written down
here, we call it Siam.”</p>

<p>“Good! A capital idea.”</p>

<p>“And now, sir, I return this paper to you in order
that you may destroy it yourself.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter, I like your methods.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. Now, prince, if you will get down to
business——”</p>

<p>“At once. But first, how much did Turnieff tell
you, and what conclusions did you draw from his manner
of telling it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“Prince, so far as the information which you
will tell me is concerned, he has told me nothing; and
his manner made no impression upon me one way or
another.”</p>

<p>The ambassador smiled.</p>

<p>“You should have gone into the diplomatic service,
Mr. Carter,” he said.</p>

<p>“I seem to be in it now, prince,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“True. But I perceive that you prefer not to commit
yourself to any opinion until you have formed a
positive one. I entirely approve of that course.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. And now, prince, one matter before
we proceed.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You have taken it for granted since my arrival
here, that I will accept the commission you wish to
give me. I will say that I am quite ready to accept
it, and that it is the sort of thing that I like to do.
But nevertheless there are conditions which I must
make before I agree to take this matter in hand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, as to that, Mr. Carter, your recompense——”</p>

<p>“I had not even thought of that part of it. When
the work is done, you will receive a bill for my services,
which I will expect you to pay. I shall supply
the money for my own expenses, and make them as
liberal as seems necessary. But I was not referring to
that subject.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“To what one, then?”</p>

<p>“To the matter in hand. I cannot take your case
and carry it through to an end, depending upon half
confidences, or only part confidences. I must be intrusted
with full and entire confidence, otherwise we
must let the matter drop where it is.”</p>

<p>“You mean—just what do you mean, Mr. Carter?”</p>

<p>“I mean that I must know <em>all</em> of the story; not
merely a part of it.”</p>

<p>“I understand you, but I doubt——”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, prince, but if you doubt, let the matter
stop where it is. There is absolutely no use continuing
it. I must have your entire confidence, or
none at all.”</p>

<p>“To give you my full confidence in the manner you
imply, Mr. Carter, I must betray the secrets of my
sovereign, which are, in part, at least, reposed in me
alone.”</p>

<p>“Even so, sir, I cannot qualify what I have said. I
cannot perform the service for you, if I am like the
horse of a picador when it enters the bull ring; blindfolded.
I must be able to see; and unless you can
intrust me with the secrets of your sovereign, as well
as with your own, I am not worthy to be trusted at
all.”</p>

<p>The ambassador was silent, tapping the top of the
desk with his pencil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>But after a moment he raised his eyes and said:</p>

<p>“So be it, Mr. Carter. I will not caval with you;
you are right. In order to carry out this matter to
a successful issue, you must know as much as I do
about it.”</p>

<p>“Just so, prince.”</p>

<p>“But bear in mind our agreement to refer to that unnamed
country as Siam.”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“I will begin, then, by stating that some years ago I
was ambassador to—er—Siam. Really, I will have to
accustom myself to that form of expression, for upon
my word I was never anywhere near Siam in my life.”</p>

<p>“Never mind a small detail like that one, prince.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed. Well, when I represented his majesty
there, certain matters arose which led me to make a
suggestion to my august master, which I believed would
redound to the credit, and greatly to the aggrandizement
also, of my own country.”</p>

<p>“And that matter was—what?”</p>

<p>“I will go into all of that presently, Mr. Carter.
It is not my purpose now to keep anything back from
you; but permit me to get over the main point of the
matter first.”</p>

<p>“As you please.”</p>

<p>“When I first proposed it, I was smiled at; then I
scored. Heed was at last taken of my suggestions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
I was directed to begin work on the idea. That, I may
say, happened ten years ago.”</p>

<p>“It is not a new thing, then.”</p>

<p>“From the point of time, it is not.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir?”</p>

<p>“I remained in—er—Siam three years longer. Then
I suggested that, in order to prosecute the work upon
which I had begun action, it would be well to place
another man there, and to send me to the court of St.
James. I figured that I could work from there, with
less chance of my purpose being discovered than from
Siam itself.”</p>

<p>“I understand you.”</p>

<p>“Two years after that, I again suggested a change,
and I came here.”</p>

<p>“So you have actually been engaged upon it five
years here in Washington.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir?”</p>

<p>“Until I came here to Washington, I had reason to
suppose that entire secrecy had been preserved; but almost
at once after my establishment here, I became convinced
that a suggestion of what I was doing, or trying
to do, had reached the government of—er—Siam. In
a short time I was sure of it. Spies from there began
to appear. Of course I have a sufficient staff of spies
at my own command, and it was not difficult for me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
to know that Siam was largely represented here. I
put two and two together, and made up my mind that
I and my work was the cause, or rather the reason of
their presence.”</p>

<p>“Naturally.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I have worked on confident in my
ability to control affairs—until now; but at last they
have succeeded in sending some person here, who has
proved to be too keen for me. Certain of my papers,
which I have safeguarded with the greatest care, have
been stolen. Those papers must be found and restored;
not because I cannot replace them, for I can do that;
but because they must not be permitted to betray what
I am doing.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.
<br />
<small>THE HOLLOW BEDPOST.</small></h2>


<p>It was twelve o’clock when Nick Carter entered
the cabinet of the ambassador; it was past four in the
morning when he went out of it, and even then he did
not leave the embassy itself, but was conducted to a
room by his host where he said he would take about
three hours’ sleep.</p>

<p>The particulars of the conversation between them
we need not give here. The facts of the case, so far
as they concern the relation of this story, have been
already given; but of one thing be assured: Nick Carter
had his way in regard to the detailed confidence of
the matters, and before parting with the ambassador he
was in possession of all the secret.</p>

<p>The thing was a stupendous undertaking on the part
of Russia, and had it been permitted to succeed, would
have altered the map of the world to a considerable
extent.</p>

<p>But the point of the case was this:</p>

<p>Important papers of vital interest to the Russian
government—and of still more vital interest to the ambassador
himself, so far as his reputation was concerned—had
been mysteriously taken from the place
where he had concealed them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not believe that they would prove of any
immediate value to that government which he disguised
under the name of Siamese, because, as he assured
the detective, it would be impossible to read even
the half that had been stolen without the presence of
the remaining half, which was still in his possession.</p>

<p>One word as to how the papers had been hidden away
by the ambassador.</p>

<p>In the first place it must be understood that all the
writing was upon exceedingly thin paper, such as is
used by diplomatic agents the world over, because it
has so little bulk that much of it can be put away
within a very small space.</p>

<p>There were twenty-two of those thin sheets of paper
in the stolen lot, and they had been rolled together
tightly as one would roll a scroll or map. Then they
had been put inside a tin cylinder that was less than
an inch in diameter, and the cylinder itself, with the
contents—now, where do you suppose a practical man
like the ambassador would hide such an affair as that?</p>

<p>In his safe? Not at all.</p>

<p>Would he deposit them in a box at a safe-deposit institution?
That would seem at first to be the logical
place; but safe-deposit vaults have been opened before
now, through subterfuge, and in other ways.</p>

<p>Moreover, it was necessary to hide them where they
could be reached quickly, in case he should want them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, the ambassador had selected a place most simple,
after all.</p>

<p>Remember that the very set of papers of which the
stolen ones formed one-half, had been a long time in
preparation when the ambassador first came to the
United States, and that the necessity for concealing
them had already arisen.</p>

<p>One day at about that time, the ambassador, in riding
through the country, across the river in Virginia,
had passed, in his automobile, a place where an auction
of household furniture was in progress.</p>

<p>He had stopped and turned back. While he looked
on at the scene, more in amusement than with interest,
an old-fashioned bedstead had been offered for sale.</p>

<p>It was a big four-poster, with canopy top and all;
it was a handsome old thing, of the best mahogany—and
the ambassador purchased it, suddenly possessed
with an idea.</p>

<p>That idea he had carried into execution before the
bed was delivered at the embassy; and it consisted in
having a hollow receptacle bored into each of the legs
of the bedstead.</p>

<p>Now stop a moment and consider just what this
meant.</p>

<p>Remember that each of the legs of the bed held a
caster; that the caster had to be affixed to a plug which
would fit into the bottom of the hole, before it could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
do its duty. Remember that the foot-end of that bedstead
was so heavy that three ordinary men could not
have lifted it from the floor after it was in place, to
remove the caster, and to get at the receptacles which
they concealed.</p>

<p>Well, that was the condition.</p>

<p>The holes were bored into the legs of the bedstead,
before the bedstead was delivered; the casters were arranged
so they could be removed. After that, the ambassador
simply kept an automobile jack in one of the
closets of his room—and so you see, he was able to
jack up the bed at any time he so desired, remove the
caster, and to get at his tin cylinders.</p>

<p>And here the ambassador had been cute again.</p>

<p>Although there was a receptacle in each one of the
legs of the bedstead, he made use of only one of them;
but that one was bored to twice the length of the tin
cylinder, and, instead of hiding the two cylinders he
wished to conceal inside two of the hollows, he put
them both in the same one; one above the other, affixing
the top one in its place by sticking it there with a piece
of wax, so that it would cling, but yet could be easily
dislodged.</p>

<p>That fact had saved one of the cylinders when the
other had been stolen.</p>

<p>Doubtless it had not occurred to the thief that both
cylinders were in the same cavity, and probably they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
had searched all four of them; but it remained that
one of them had not been taken.</p>

<p>The problem was, how had any person been able
to discover the hiding place?</p>

<p>The ambassador assured Nick Carter that no other
person than himself was aware of the hiding place;
that he had never taken any person into his confidence,
not even his wife or his daughter.</p>

<p>The room was his own room, which he occupied
alone; the bed was so huge an affair that it was never
moved from its position. How, then, had any person
determined where the hiding place had been arranged?</p>

<p>The ambassador asked the detective all these questions;
and to them Nick replied:</p>

<p>“It does not interest us to know how the hiding
place was discovered, unless that was the quickest way
of recovering the lost papers; but it is not. The only
thing for us is the fact that they were taken—and it
is a clear and logical deduction that whoever took them
has passed them on to another person.”</p>

<p>“That is undoubtedly true,” the ambassador replied.</p>

<p>“What excuse have you made for keeping that automobile
jack in your room?”</p>

<p>“None at all. I simply kept it there.”</p>

<p>“How often was it your habit to remove those papers
from their hiding place?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not once in six months. Only when there was
something to be added to them.”</p>

<p>“When was the last time that you had them out, before
you discovered the loss?”</p>

<p>“Rather more than a month ago.”</p>

<p>“How did it happen that you discovered the loss?”</p>

<p>“Very simply. I found the jack in the middle of
the floor. The sight of it there alarmed me. I closed
the door, pulled the curtains, examined the hollow
post, and discovered what had happened.”</p>

<p>“Now, just when was that?”</p>

<p>“Exactly one week ago to-night.”</p>

<p>“What time of day or night was it when you made
the discovery?”</p>

<p>“It was two o’clock in the morning. The papers
were stolen between nine o’clock that night and then.
I had been inside of my room at nine o’clock in the
evening, and everything was in order then. I
passed the evening at a theatre, and accompanied
some friends to supper after it. It was two when I
entered my room and made the discovery.”</p>

<p>So much for the manner of the loss.</p>

<p>Concerning the papers themselves, Nick had asked
the following questions:</p>

<p>“You have referred to the swarm of spies for that
other government, who are now in the city, presumably
for the sole purpose of watching you. How many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
them do you know, or, how many of them have you
knowledge about?”</p>

<p>“Just an even dozen.”</p>

<p>“Have you reason to believe that there are more
than that number here?”</p>

<p>“There may be another dozen, or a score more of
them, for all I know.”</p>

<p>“How could they, or any of them, discover the
existence of the papers in the first place?”</p>

<p>“Merely by conjecture; but it was a natural conclusion.
They must know that it has been necessary,
during all these years since I have been engaged on
the matter, to keep very careful data. My memory
could not be depended upon in a matter so vital. Hence,
it has been a perfectly natural assumption that such
papers existed. The thing was, to discover the hiding
place—and it was discovered.”</p>

<p>“Have you reason to suppose that any other effort
than this one has even been made to steal the papers?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. There have been seven or eight attempts
during the ten years, or, rather, during the last
seven of them; all but one during the last five.”</p>

<p>“What was done at those attempts?”</p>

<p>“Oh, burglars have entered my house. Thieves of
the sneak-thief order have ransacked my rooms at one
time and another, notwithstanding my watchfulness.
A box at a safe-deposit institution was opened through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
subterfuge—but nothing was taken from it, and I
would not have discovered that strange hands had
been inside it, had not the manager mentioned something
about the man I had sent there.”</p>

<p>There was one other point concerning which we will
repeat some of the conversation between the detective
and the ambassador.</p>

<p>“Of the dozen spies whom you know to be in this
city, keeping watch on you, and of whom you have
given me a list, which are the ones you deem most
competent to have carried this theft into effect?”</p>

<p>“Either of the first two on the list. The man,
Rafael Delorme, and the woman, Dolores Delorme,
his wife. They are unquestionably at the head of the
system of spies, which we call Siamese; the others are
only their puppets.”</p>

<p>“Do they know that you are aware of their business
here?”</p>

<p>“They would be very poor spies indeed if they were
not aware of it—and they are the slickest of their
kind.”</p>

<p>“There is no other one among the twelve whom you
think is clever enough to have done this thing?”</p>

<p>“Any one of them is clever enough, if directed by
either of the Delormes; but with the possible exception
of Jules Legrande, who is really a Greek, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
his French name, I don’t think any one
of them could have carried it off alone.”</p>

<p>“Now, outside of this dozen on the list, is there any
other person in Washington, man or woman, toward
whom your suspicions have been directed, believing
that he or she might be a spy in the service of Siam?”</p>

<p>“Yes. There is one.”</p>

<p>“Who is that one, prince?”</p>

<p>“She is called Countess Narnine. She acknowledges
the given name of Juno. In Paris, St. Petersburg,
Vienna, and other cities of Europe, she was long
known as ‘The Leopard.’ And I wish to assure you,
Mr. Carter, that she is more dangerous than all the
others put together—if she is a—er—Siamese spy.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.
<br />
<small>THE WOMAN SPY.</small></h2>


<p>“Juno again,” the detective had mused, when he
heard that statement; but he did not say it aloud, although
he did question the ambassador on one more
point which the mention of her name had brought to
his mind.</p>

<p>“Your letter to me implied that you had some reason
to suspect Turnieff; if not of the theft itself, then
of something. What was it, and why did you select
him?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I do not suspect Turnieff, and I do not wish to be
so understood. My belief in him is as thorough as it
can be, and I would require positive proof to convince
me of his disloyalty. Yet, Mr. Carter, in a case of
this kind, one suspects everybody.”</p>

<p>“Well, go on, please. Tell me exactly why you mentioned
him to me in your letter, in the manner you
used; why you thought it necessary to write a special
letter to me about it.”</p>

<p>“I had two reasons,” the ambassador replied, without
hesitation. “I will give them to you exactly as they
occurred to me.”</p>

<p>“Please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is no one in this household who is so near
to me in a confidential capacity as Turnieff—not even
my secretary. I have always, ever since he has been
with me, intended to employ him as one of the messengers,
when the time should come to send the documents
to my august master.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“It has been necessary that one member of my household
should know that I had a secret mission, in addition
to my regular one. Turnieff does not know,
has not known, and would never know until after its
completion, what that mission is. But he does know
what the name of the country is which you and I have
designated by the name of Siam. Now, that is one
point, and it is every bit as far as it goes. It would
break Turnieff’s heart if he believed that I had suggested
that much about him.”</p>

<p>“But there is more?”</p>

<p>“Yes; on an entirely different basis.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p>“It refers to that woman who has purchased the
title, or has married it, or has procured it in some way
that makes it hers, and gives her a right to use it—Countess
Narnine.”</p>

<p>“Juno,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“Yes. That is the first name she claims. I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
heard that it is hers, more than many of the others she
has made use of in the past.”</p>

<p>“In what way do you associate Turnieff with her?
Why should any association with her by him give rise
to suspicion against him?”</p>

<p>“I have said that it does not amount to suspicion
against him; only that I must search in every direction
around me, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I understand.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will speak of the woman first before I refer
to him in connection with her.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>“Once upon a time, to my certain knowledge, that
woman served Russia in the capacity of secret agent.
On that occasion she was sent to Paris, in company
with the father of Turnieff. There were strange things
that happened there. The woman evidently sold out to
others, although it could never be established that she
did so—and actually she finally succeeded in proving
the charge against another. You may rest assured that
that other person died very suddenly—as she would
have done, had she not established her innocence.”</p>

<p>“I don’t go in for assassination, prince.”</p>

<p>“Nor I. But sudden deaths happen frequently among
traitors in the secret-agent business, nevertheless. The
woman has been in the service of other countries since
then, we have reason to think, although we do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
know it. Just now she appears to have somehow succeeded
to great wealth, and to be living on her income,
which seems large. There is not a thing or a circumstance
to disprove that view. Nevertheless, she is
here, and there is no reason on earth why she should
be here, unless it is in the interests of Siam.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“She is cleverer than the cleverest. She is almost
uncanny in her abilities and profound astuteness. While
I haven’t a thing to bear me out in what I say, I haven’t
a doubt on earth that she is, at this moment, a Siamese
spy.”</p>

<p>“And as such——”</p>

<p>“Wait; I haven’t quite got to that yet. During that
Paris experience of hers, to which I just now referred,
when she was an aid to my friend Alexis Turnieff, the
father of my military aide, he was killed. It was said
that he shot himself. Circumstances surrounding the
affair upheld that view of the matter; but those who
knew the man personally knew then, and know now,
that he was not the man to have taken his own life.
He was the soul of honor and uprightness. A large
fortune in cash and jewels disappeared at the time
of his death, and was stolen—if it can be said that
things are stolen when they are taken by the people
to whom they really belong.</p>

<p>“But that money and the jewels had been forfeited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
to the throne. Ah, well! That is political history, and
has nothing to do with the things I am telling you;
only I wished to say that the jewels and money probably
found its way to just the hands where Russia did
not wish it to go.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Carter, I have always believed, and I believe
now, that ‘The Leopard’ caused the death of
Prince Turnieff, if she did not actually shoot him herself—and
I more than half believe that.”</p>

<p>“And you are attempting to tell me that young Turnieff
believes that view of the case also.”</p>

<p>“I am attempting to tell you more than that. What
I started to say was that ever since Countess Narnine
appeared here, Turnieff has been a devotee at her
shrine. He has fluttered around her like a moth around
a candle flame. He has been in her train constantly.
He goes nightly to her house; or, when he is not there,
he is an attendant at functions where he knows she
will be present.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me that he is in love with
her?”</p>

<p>“No; not unless love and hate are akin. He is bent
on vengeance for the untimely death of his father.
That is why he pursues her.”</p>

<p>“Then how do you find a cause for suspicion against
him in this matter, because of his intimacy with the
countess?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah; there you have me again. I do not know. I
cannot answer that question save in a most general
way.”</p>

<p>“Well, in a general way, then.”</p>

<p>“I know that woman’s possibilities; I know her capabilities—or
at least some of them. Wherever she is
concerned, I am afraid; not for myself, for I think I
am above and beyond her wiles; but for others.”</p>

<p>“Just what do you mean to imply, prince?”</p>

<p>“That Turnieff would be as clay in her hands, if
she chose to exert herself against him; that she would
play with him as a tigress might play with a tiny
mouse—or as her namesake, the leopard, might toy
with a kitten. With her, he is as a child in the hands of
a giant.”</p>

<p>“Still I do not see——”</p>

<p>“No, nor do I. But I have heard it said that she
has great powers of fascination; that strong men have
gone down beneath her wiles; that she molds men as
potters mold clay. May it not be that she has found
a way to mold him, and to turn him into a traitor to
me and to his emperor?”</p>

<p>“That is going rather far, isn’t it, prince?”</p>

<p>“Yes; too far. I admit that. But I try to look on
every side. Mr. Carter, I would like to make a suggestion,
if you will permit it. I have said that you
should go your own way entirely about this case, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
all the same there is one suggestion that I would like
to make.”</p>

<p>“What is it? Make it by all means.”</p>

<p>“Go and see that woman. Manage to be introduced
to her in such a way that she will be forced to receive
you. Interest her. Study her. Try to read her. Try
to fathom the unsounded depths of her. Then come
to me and tell me about her.”</p>

<p>“You seem to have entire confidence that I may not
become one of her many victims,” the detective remarked,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“I had not thought of it; really. It had not occurred
to me. Perhaps, after all, you had best keep
away from her.”</p>

<p>The detective laughed outright.</p>

<p>“I observe, prince, that you do fear her. But I
think that you need have no fear for me. I will confess
to you that I have already seen her and know her.
I have met her and talked with her, twice, in fact.”</p>

<p>“You have?”</p>

<p>“Yes; once in this country, when she happened to
be a Mrs. Ledger Dinwiddie; once again in Paris—after
that. But the fact remains that I can claim an
old acquaintanceship with her, and that I do not think
she will be inclined to deny it to me.”</p>

<p>“Ah! That is good—perhaps.”</p>

<p>“I think it is very good; for I entirely agree with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
you that she is in this city in the interests of Siam; that
she has been sent here to discover your secrets; that she,
and not the Delormes, husband and wife, engineered
the theft of those papers—and that now she will be
more eager than ever to get possession of the other
half of them.”</p>

<p>“Then you will seek her?”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>“Beware of her, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“Forewarned is forearmed, you know, prince,”
laughed the detective. “But that reminds me of something
that I must say to you on that point.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I know the habits of you gentlemen, when a man
like myself is engaged in your service. You have one
of your regular spies watch that man. I will have
none of that, prince. If I discover that it is done
in my case—and I shall discover it if it is done—I
will throw up your case on the instant, and have nothing
more to do with it.”</p>

<p>“It shall not be done, Mr. Carter, I promise you.”</p>

<p>“Another thing: If you should get reports from
any person that I seem to be worshiping at the shrine
of the countess, along with Turnieff, you are to understand
that it is a part of the game, and that I am doing
it with my eyes wide open, although they may have
the appearance of being closed all the time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will understand.”</p>

<p>“In the meantime let Turnieff continue as he has
started out. Let him have his head and go as far as he
likes. I may use him as a foil in what I intend to do.”</p>

<p>“But you are going to probe into the life of that
woman; eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and so deeply that she will wince. So thoroughly
that if she stole those documents we will recover
possession of them; and that, too, very soon.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could be assured of that, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.
<br />
<small>IN THE NET OF A SIREN.</small></h2>


<p>Nick Carter paused just inside the doorway.</p>

<p>The scene before him was a resplendent one, and not
to be duplicated in the city of Washington, so rumor
had said; certainly, the hostess who presided over it
all was not to be duplicated anywhere else in the
world.</p>

<p>For the scene upon which the detective looked was
that of a formal function at the home of Countess
Juno Narnine and the countess herself defied vocabularies,
when an adequate description of her was sought.</p>

<p>The detective had thought it best to wear no disguise
at all; to appear there in his own proper person;
to come upon the hostess suddenly and without announcement,
and so to surprise her, if that were possible,
although he had not a doubt that she had been informed
of his presence in the city.</p>

<p>He had managed purposely to arrive at the house
rather late, and already the parlors were thronged with
guests, for hers was one of the most popular houses in
the capital—not alone because of the beauty of the
hostess, but because of the entertainment one found
there, and the people one met there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>As Nick halted he drew backward a little, screening
himself for a moment behind other persons who were
only too eager to crowd ahead of him, for he wished
to study the scene for a time before he thrust himself
directly into it.</p>

<p>He saw her at the far end of the room, the centre
of a throng that had gathered around her chair; for
she sat like an enthroned queen, upon a raised dais, the
better to receive her guests—and the moment had not
yet come for her to leave it and to mingle with them.</p>

<p>The admiration that was given to her was not
stinted; and it was due, moreover, for the detective
confessed to himself then and there that never had he
seen a more beautiful human creature.</p>

<p>Brightness, vivacity, wit—every attribute that goes
to adorn beauty and make it a compelling factor were
hers.</p>

<p>Statesmen, professional men, persons of prominence
in every walk of life were grouped around her, each
vying with all the others to do homage to her charms.</p>

<p>Such was the scene upon which Nick Carter gazed
as he paused just inside the doorway and studied the
environment.</p>

<p>“A wonderful woman, truly,” he told himself, with
just the suggestion of a shrug, and he withdrew still
farther into the background, waiting for a better opportunity
to present himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>The moment came at last.</p>

<p>He saw that she was about to leave her raised chair
and to mingle with her guests. He discerned an uneasy
movement around her which told him that; and just
at the instant when he believed that he would be in
time, he moved forward and stood before her.</p>

<p>She had been talking with a man who stood beside
her, and did not notice his approach; did not realize
that another guest had approached until he stood directly
before her. Then she raised her eyes and saw
him.</p>

<p>A person standing near them and watching her
would not have noticed that her expression changed at
all; but Nick Carter saw that it did.</p>

<p>There was just the slightest narrowing of the eyes;
just an added depth to them; just the suggestion of a
slight start in her attitude, unobservable to others, but
plainly noted by the detective, although it endured not
more than the fraction of an instant.</p>

<p>Then, her face beamed. A bright smile, which was
also glad in its expression, illumined her eyes and her
features. You would have said that she was unqualifiedly
delighted to discover him there.</p>

<p>She did what she had not done to another guest that
evening. She started from her chair and extended her
hand in cordial greeting; and she followed that hand
with the other one, thus signally honoring him by giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
him both. He took them both, and for a moment
held them, looking down into her eyes as he did so, with
an expression which the spectators took to be one of
intense admiration, if not more; with an expression
which she must have seen, and noted, and wondered
about, too, in her inmost heart.</p>

<p>The murmurs about them became hushed for the
instant.</p>

<p>It seemed as if all eyes in the room were fixed upon
those two; and yet no one stood quite near enough to
them to hear her low-toned greeting, or his reply to it.</p>

<p>“You have not forgotten?” she murmured, with that
bewitching smile which could not have been counterfeited
by another.</p>

<p>“I am here; that should be your answer,” he returned,
and he smiled back at her.</p>

<p>She did another thing then that was not in accordance
with her usual custom. She took his arm deliberately
when she knew that a dozen others were
waiting near, to have that very honor bestowed upon
them—and among them it may be said that Colonel
Alexis Turnieff was one—and she said:</p>

<p>“It is my habit to rest for a few moments in the
conservatory, after the fatigue of the reception. Take
me there, please.”</p>

<p>The others drew backward, away from them. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
lane was formed through the throng, and Nick walked
through it with Juno clinging to his arm, the envied
of every man in the room.</p>

<p>No one could surmise why she had signaled him out
for this especial honor. Nick Carter would have found
it difficult to have told the reason himself; perhaps she
had none, and it was only a whim and impulse.</p>

<p>But nevertheless Nick asked himself if she had in
mind the last scene between them, in the parlor of her
suite of rooms in Paris, when she had believed that
she hypnotized him. The detective caught himself
wondering if she had discovered since then the fraud
that he had practiced upon her.</p>

<p>“She must have discovered it,” he told himself.
“She knows that the orders she gave me when she supposed
me to be under the hypnotic spell were not
carried out. She knows that Bare-Faced Jimmy was
brought back to this country, and tried, and convicted.
She must know all of that.”</p>

<p>But these thoughts found no outward expression on
the part of the detective. He walked along beside her,
with her arm clinging to his, and so they passed among
the guests, and at last went through a draped doorway
and entered upon a spacious conservatory.</p>

<p>Others were there, to be sure; but there was one seat
which was sacred to the hostess, and it was an unwritten
law of the house that when she occupied it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
another she was not to be disturbed, save by her expressed
wish.</p>

<p>She guided the detective toward it, seated herself,
and motioned Nick to a place beside her.</p>

<p>“Now,” she said to him, “we are as isolated here as
if we were behind closed doors with a substantial
guard at every outlet. No one approaches me when
I am here, unless I request it, so we can converse for
a time undisturbed.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it an unusual honor that you do me, countess?”
the detective asked, replying to her.</p>

<p>“No; not particularly. I always bring a companion
here with me, after the fatigue of receiving for two
hours on that raised dais. Now—why are you here?”</p>

<p>“Can you ask that, countess?”</p>

<p>“I do ask it,” she smiled back at him.</p>

<p>“I am here because I had the impulse to come. I
have not forgotten our last interview.”</p>

<p>“No? I had hoped that you might forget it—at
least, a part of it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is the part you would have me forget
that I best remember,” he replied softly.</p>

<p>“I beg, Mr. Carter, that you will not be like all
the others, and begin by making love to me offhand,
as if I expected it as my due. Be original at least,
for I know that you are not in the least in that condition.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>“What does not exist, may be made to exist,
countess. Love commands most people, but it seems to
me that you have transposed the rule, and that you
command love.”</p>

<p>She shrugged her white shoulders and laughed
softly; she also flushed, and turned her matchless eyes
full upon him for a moment, remaining silent while
she did so. Then she replied with studied deliberation:</p>

<p>“No; I do not command love. If I could, I would
do so now. Do you regard that as rather a bald statement,
my friend? Perhaps it is so; but nevertheless it
is true. Have you ever walked past beautiful grounds
that surrounded a mansion which attracted you, and
have you said to yourself, in passing it, ‘If I could
enter and claim it as mine, I would throw open the
gate and enter’?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. I have not thought of it in exactly that
way.”</p>

<p>“No? I will draw the simile a bit farther. You
see in that place a haven where you might, if you
would, enter and be happy and content forevermore;
but you look a second time and discover that the gate
is locked against you—so you pass on your way. You
remember the garden of flowers, and the mansion only
vaguely, yet knowing that you could have been content
had you entered there. Do you understand me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am afraid not, countess.”</p>

<p>“You do, but you will not admit it. Well, I will
be more explicit. The atmosphere around you, Mr.
Carter, is the garden of flowers; you are the mansion;
but the gate is locked against me, and I may not enter.
Sometimes, my friend, we pass such scenes too late in
life to know where to search for the key.”</p>

<p>She was still looking into his eyes.</p>

<p>She had bent nearer to him. There was a deeper
flush upon her cheeks and brow, and her eyes were
glowing with a light which must, in her early life,
have given her the name of Siren.</p>

<p>She reached out one hand tentatively, and permitted
it to fall upon the back of one of his hands. Her
fingers tightened upon it, almost imperceptibly, yet they
tightened, and they clung there.</p>

<p>The detective felt the thrill of her; realized the
magnetism of the woman; knew the danger he courted;
understood that she was openly making a bid for his
admiration—perhaps for something more.</p>

<p>He found himself returning her gaze; he saw her
lips, dimly, as through a haze, and he knew that they
were protected from the view of others by the screen
of leaves that shaded them—and then he saw one of
her white arms steal softly upward toward him, and
he knew that in another instant it would wind itself
around his neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>Still he did not move.</p>

<p>He caught the wrist of that white arm just in time,
and gently but firmly he forced it back again upon
her lap, although he did not attempt to remove her
other hand, where it was resting on the back of one
of his.</p>

<p>“You refuse me the key?” she murmured, so low
that it was almost a whisper. “You keep the gate
locked against me? You shut me out, leave me in the
cold? Are you wise to do that, my friend?”</p>

<p>“Who shall tell what wisdom is, Juno?” he replied
to her. “When we deem ourselves the wisest, we are
often the most stupid. But you are right, nevertheless.
The gate is locked—only there are two gates
instead of one, and that one behind which you are
sheltered is an impregnable one. I would not dare to
open it if I could do so, and I doubt if I could.”</p>

<p>“You charge me with insincerity, my friend?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that term is also ambiguous, countess. You
are sincere enough so far as your purpose is concerned;
but that purpose is not what you would have me think
it is.”</p>

<p>She drew her hand away from his. For a time she
was silent, and Nick, watching her, saw that she was
thinking deeply. He waited, wondering what would
be the fruit of that thought.</p>

<p>At last she turned to him, and looked into his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
again; but now her expression had changed greatly;
there was a depth to it which he had not seen there
before.</p>

<p>“Will you believe me if I speak to you with entire
frankness?” she asked him.</p>

<p>“Yes, countess. At least I will try to do so.”</p>

<p>“I will be, for once at least, entirely sincere.”</p>

<p>“I believe that you mean what you say.”</p>

<p>“Then listen. This scene between us outrages all
precedent, does it not?”</p>

<p>“In a way it does; yes.”</p>

<p>“I invited you to come here with me to this secluded
corner of my conservatory. I drew you down
upon the seat beside me. I have deliberately made love
to you, and I have as deliberately, by my actions,
given you permission to take me into your arms—I,
who have the power to command the love of almost
any man in those rooms yonder. That is true, isn’t
it, my friend?”</p>

<p>“Quite true.”</p>

<p>“I did not begin, as I would have done if I were
playing at love, did I, by inviting you to make love
to me, by using coy glances, and all the little arts that
a woman is master of—I did not do any of that.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will tell you why I have outraged precedent.
It is because, when I drew that comparison between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
you and the mansion with its garden of flowers, I
spoke the truth. You have attracted me strangely,
Nick Carter; not as other men might do, but as only
you could do, and have done it. I can see in you the
possibilities of supreme content—and Heaven knows
that I long for content, as we all long for the unattainable.
I do not love you—but I could love you.
You are not necessary to me—but you could be so.
One does not fall into love blindly—at least not one
like I am, or like you are, possessed of brain and of
judgment. I wonder if you understand me now?”</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“You know who I am. I know that you do know;
and yet you have kept the secret. You are aware that
I was born to better things; that no woman in the
world is better connected than I am. Yet in my youth
I threw that all away from me and went out into the
world, driven there by one foolish act, and I have been
in that world ever since buffeted by it; maligned by
it. In that outer world there is no content anywhere.</p>

<p>“I am like other women in that I long for content.
I am like other women in that I have a heart for love.
I am like other women in that I am loyal to one thing
at least, and that is to myself. I am like other women
after all, and it is only those who do not know my
real self who think me different. Can you understand
that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. I think so.”</p>

<p>“You have the key to content, if you will give it to
me. I hate this life of mine, in which there is nothing
that is true and real. I crave the real things of
life—and, my friend, all the real things of life depend
upon just one quality—love.</p>

<p>“Wait, my friend, bear with me just a moment
longer. Now that I have begun—and I have never
talked frankly to any person before now—I have the
wish to complete what I began to say.”</p>

<p>“Yes, countess.”</p>

<p>“When the sinner, moved by the exhortations of
the revivalist, goes down in front and falls upon his
knees and is converted, that sinner becomes a changed
being. All the black past is forgotten. Redemption
has been found. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am that sinner. All that has gone before
in my checkered life could be forever forgotten, and
my soul might be saved—with that key to the gate
of content which you could hold out to me—if you
would.”</p>

<p>“Countess, I——”</p>

<p>“And you and I together—ah, what could we not
accomplish? You in your profession, and I helping
you, assisting you, working for you and with you!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Think of it! Think of the perfection of it! The
beauty of it! But—the gate is closed and locked.”</p>

<p>“The gate is closed and locked,” he replied soberly.</p>

<p>“And yet, Nick Carter, I am a good woman. You
doubt it, but it is true. I have not been good perhaps
in the little things of life, but in the great ones I have
been so. No man lives who can point his finger at
me in scorn; no man who is dead might have ever done
so. I have never committed a crime in my life, or
abetted one, although I have been accused of many
crimes.”</p>

<p>“And yet, countess——”</p>

<p>“Ah!” she interrupted him. “I know what you
would say. You would charge me with things that the
chief of police in Paris told you about. You would
say that I had lured men to their death. It is not
true. You would say that men have killed themselves
because of me. It is not true in so far as it was a
studied fault of mine, or that I led them to it, or was
willfully responsible for it.</p>

<p>“My life has been a strange one, my friend. One
may cleave closely to the awful precipices, and yet
avoid them. That is true, is it not?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it is quite true.”</p>

<p>“Nicholas Carter, I would at least have you judge
me fairly—and the day will come when you will do so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>She stopped suddenly, laughed in a low tone, and
half turned away.</p>

<p>“And now,” she said, with an entire change of
tone, “let us return to present things and to the life
we really live, not the one which we would like to
live. The life we do live is false, hollow, filled with
deceits, subterfuges, lies! The life I long to live in
is true, sound, upright, filled with fairness and frankness
and honesty. Now again—why are you here
to-night?”</p>

<p>“I came here to this house, countess, expressly to
see you and to talk with you.”</p>

<p>“Then you have accomplished your desire. Why
are you in Washington?”</p>

<p>“I am here in pursuit of my profession.”</p>

<p>“Ah; that is frankness, at least—and we were not
to be frank with each other any more, were we?”</p>

<p>“You must follow your own bent in that particular,
countess, and permit me to follow mine.”</p>

<p>She arose from the seat she had been occupying,
and he rose also and stood near her.</p>

<p>“I will return frankness with frankness—for this
once,” she said, with one of her inscrutable smiles.
“I know why you are here. I will tell you enough to
assure you that I do know it; enough to assure you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
that I am aware of your own shrewdness, and therefore
am perfectly assured of what you suspect me.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“You came to Washington at the invitation of the
ambassador for Russia. That invitation was taken
to you in person by colonel, the Prince Alexis Turnieff—who
believes that I murdered his father, or at
least was the cause of his death. You have become
convinced that I am in the service of a country which,
at this time, believes it has reason to keep a sharp
watch upon the things that Russia is doing, or is attempting
to do, and you have taken it upon yourself
to watch me. Isn’t that true?”</p>

<p>“Since you believe it, countess, it seems a waste of
words to say that it is, or that it is not true. Have
it so, if you wish.”</p>

<p>“Ah; you will not be quite frank with me.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is best, countess, that we meet on the
common ground of distrust.”</p>

<p>She started away from him. The remark stung her,
and he could see that it had done so, although he had
not intended to hurt her by what he said.</p>

<p>For a moment she stared at him, hard-eyed, suddenly
cold, and he caught a glimpse of the other side
of this woman’s character.</p>

<p>“We meet on the common ground of distrust,” she
repeated after him. “So be it. I was not minded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
have it so; but so be it. The common ground of distrust,
say you! So be it. Mr. Carter, I must become
willfully guilty of a grave breach of courtesy. I must
tell you to your face that your presence here in my
home is not congenial. I must ask you to leave it. I
must inform you that your presence will not be tolerated
here again.”</p>

<p>The detective stared at her in amazement.</p>

<p>He had not expected this; had not anticipated anything
of the kind. Truly hers was a many-sided character.</p>

<p>While he stared, she smiled ironically upon him.
Then she raised her two hands and clapped them together
loudly.</p>

<p>Instantly in response to the signal, many who were
in the conservatory came toward them, and two servants
hastened forward also, as if the clapping of her
hands were a well-known signal to them.</p>

<p>Juno did not speak again until many of her guests
and the servants were quite near.</p>

<p>Then she turned and spoke again, directly to the
detective.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter,” she said, and there was no mistaking
tone and air of offense which she managed to introduce
into her voice and manner, “my servants will
show you the way out. I believe that is all.”</p>

<p>With a gesture that was worthy of an offended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
queen, she turned away from him, while the guests
who had been observers of the scene stood and stared.
One of the two servants moved forward.</p>

<p>“This way if you please, sir,” he said. He had received
his orders and he meant to execute them.</p>

<p>Alexis Turnieff strode forward to the centre of the
group. His face was white and drawn with concentrated
passion.</p>

<p>“One moment——” he began; but by a gesture
Juno stopped him.</p>

<p>“Not another word, Alexis,” she said sharply.
“Your arm, if you please.” And then: “My servants
will show this man the way out. Come.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br />
<small>A FIGHT IN THE STREET.</small></h2>


<p>Nick Carter stopped at the corner just below the
house to consider what had happened.</p>

<p>Unceremoniously he had been ejected from the home
of the countess. Undeniably she had defied him, and
she had managed to do it in the presence of many
others among her guests. There was no doubt whatever
that the affair would be the talk of the town by
another day, and it would be surprising indeed if the
whole thing were not a column long, or more in the
morning papers.</p>

<p>The detective had been placed in many trying positions
during the course of his experience, but never
had he met with one which had been quite so original
as this one.</p>

<p>Why had she done it, he asked himself as he stood
there in thought, at the corner.</p>

<p>Was it because when she found she could not make
a puppet of him she had resorted to the other extremity?</p>

<p>Had she really intended to make a puppet of him, or
had she been sincere during those moments in the
conservatory?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>Who could tell? She had appeared sincere enough;
but who could tell?</p>

<p>What was the detective to do now? It was out
of the question that he should return to her house
in any guise whatever. Juno read a part of his character
well, in realizing that, driven thus from her
house, Nick Carter would not return to it under any
circumstances—unless, indeed, it were to make an
arrest.</p>

<p>But it went without saying that he could not go
there again as a guest, even in disguise. A detective
has to do many things which are not congenial, but he
does not have to do ungentlemanly or dishonorable
things. This woman had seemed to know that in
forcing him out of her house in the manner she had
done, she had rid herself of his presence there for good.</p>

<p>And to arrest her was out of the question.</p>

<p>That could not be done under any circumstances,
even if he could provide himself with proof positive
that she had gone in person to the house of the ambassador,
had entered it with burglarious intent, and
had stolen the tin cylinder with its contents.</p>

<p>That would constitute a theft, of course; and the
breaking and entering would be burglary under the
law; but to accuse her, arrest her, or attempt to prosecute
her for it, would be to defeat the ends at which
his effort was aimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be also to nullify and destroy every effect
of the ambassador’s labors for ten years.</p>

<p>Another man in Nick Carter’s place in that conservatory
might have permitted Juno to twine her
arms around his neck, and might have seized her in his
arms and embraced her—might have made the most
of that opportunity which she offered, and have traded
upon that chance to accomplish what he wished to do.</p>

<p>Not so Nick Carter.</p>

<p>Another man might have gone far in succumbing
to her, and might well have considered the case upon
which he was engaged well lost—and all the world of
self-respect with it—to have won Juno’s love.</p>

<p>Not so Nick Carter.</p>

<p>Without egotism, he believed that she had been sincere
to a certain extent in outlining her longing for
content, and in her belief that with such a man as he
she might find it; nor could he deny to himself that
Juno possessed a powerful attraction for him.</p>

<p>But that terrible <em>if</em>.</p>

<p>If Juno had been different; if circumstances had not
been just what they were; if the world had wagged
differently.</p>

<p>“Bosh!” he ejaculated aloud, and started to move
on. Instantly he was conscious that a heavy hand fell
upon his shoulder, and he heard a voice exclaim:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait a moment, sir!”</p>

<p>The detective turned about. Before him, tall and
straight with his military manner, stood Alexis Turnieff.</p>

<p>“Ah, colonel——” he began; but the Russian stepped
forward nearer to the detective.</p>

<p>He uttered an epithet. His arm swung outward
and around, and if it had been permitted to continue
upon its course, the open palm of Turnieff’s right hand
must have been brought into sharp contact with Nick
Carter’s cheek.</p>

<p>The detective saw the blow coming and met it halfway.</p>

<p>He caught the swinging wrist, twisted it, wheeled
around and drew it down sharply across his shoulder,
bent forward, exerted his strength, jerked—and sent
Turnieff flying over his head and over the low iron
fence near where they stood, so that the Russian landed
on the soft green sod beyond it.</p>

<p>It was a jujutsu trick that the detective made use
of, and although it badly jarred the recipient of it,
the man was not injured.</p>

<p>Turnieff leaped to his feet again with a cry of
rage, and with a curse on his lips rushed forward
toward the fence which separated them.</p>

<p>But the fence stopped him, and so did Nick Carter,
for he reached out one hand and seized the Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
by the collar and held him so, pulling him tightly up
against the iron pickets in such a way that he could
not escape.</p>

<p>And he held him there.</p>

<p>“Don’t be an ass, Turnieff!” he said. “I am in the
humor just now to box somebody’s ears, and yours
would serve as well as another’s. What is the matter
with you, anyhow? Why did you attack me?”</p>

<p>“Release me if you are not a coward!” stormed
Turnieff.</p>

<p>“I’m not a coward; neither will I release you.
Big as you are, Turnieff, you are only a child in my
grasp. You must realize that now. Why did you
attack me?”</p>

<p>“You insulted the countess, you——”</p>

<p>“There, there, now! Colonel Turnieff, I have never
insulted a woman in my life, much less one who was
my hostess. Did she say that I insulted her? Did she
tell you that?”</p>

<p>“No; but her actions——”</p>

<p>“Ah! Her actions. I see. You have no other
reason for attacking me than what you saw in the
conservatory?”</p>

<p>“No; but that was sufficient, heaven knows.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, you have been misled. The countess
was offended, I’ll admit; but it was because I
would not do things which no man of honor could do;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
not because I affronted her in any manner, for I did
not. Do you believe me?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Turnieff, if I did not feel a certain degree of pity
for you, I would chuck you back on the grass and leave
you. As it is, I am sorry for you. You have been
endeavoring to hate this woman whom you believe
killed your father, or caused his death, and instead
you are in love with her. You have gone into her
presence time after time, deceiving yourself into the
idea that you were seeking vengeance, when in reality
you were only a moth playing around a flame which,
unless you break away, will consume you utterly. Believe
me, it is true.”</p>

<p>“Release me, I say! Let me go.”</p>

<p>“What will you do if I let you go?”</p>

<p>“I will strike you in the face to discover if there
is any fight in you.”</p>

<p>“Listen to me a moment, colonel, and then I will
let you go. Do you realize that I am now in the
service of your country, and am acting under the
direct commands of your ambassador? Do you understand
that you are jeopardizing your whole career
at this moment? If I should report to the ambassador
what you have done, you would be sent back to
St. Petersburg at once. For what are you so conducting
yourself?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>The man struggled fiercely, but Nick Carter held
him; and the detective saw that he was coming to
his senses, too.</p>

<p>“I shall release you now, Turnieff,” he said, and
suited the action to the word. “There is a gate yonder;
pass through it. We will walk down the avenue
together while we talk. I only hope for your own
sake that no person has seen this affair.”</p>

<p>But Turnieff did not reply. Neither did he follow
the advice of the detective and go to the gate. He
stood quite still, staring at Nick, evidently impressed
by what had been said to him, but too stubborn to do
as was suggested.</p>

<p>And Nick, half disgusted by all of the events of the
night, turned away.</p>

<p>“I shall say nothing of this affair to the ambassador,”
he said. “From me, he will be made no wiser
concerning what has occurred between you and me to-night,
and I advise you to be silent on the subject, also.
In the morning when your temper has cooled, we will
discuss it. Good night.”</p>

<p>He moved on down the thoroughfare, which happened
to be Connecticut Avenue.</p>

<p>Turnieff stung to madness by the coolness, not unmixed
with contempt of the detective, leaped the
pickets of the iron fence and rushed after him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will fight. I will make you fight,” he exclaimed.
“If you won’t meet me as gentlemen should
meet, then have it this way,” and he struck wildly at
the detective again.</p>

<p>Nick turned in time to ward off the blow, but not
soon enough to prevent the savage rush of the Russian
having its effect.</p>

<p>For Turnieff was no weakling, although Nick Carter
was greatly the stronger of the two. The Russian
clinched, winding his long arms around the detective’s
body with such tenacity that it was all that
Nick could do to escape the consequences of it.</p>

<p>They struggled for a moment there in the middle
of the sidewalk; but at the end of that moment Nick
threw Turnieff away from him with such force that
the man staggered backward, and finally fell to his
knees on the cement flagging.</p>

<p>As he did so three men rushed forward out of the
darkness, coming apparently from nowhere, for Nick
had not suspected their nearness.</p>

<p>They reached the fallen man ere he could get upon
his feet and they seized upon him, evidently to assist
him—that was how Nick regarded their intentions.</p>

<p>As they grasped Turnieff, as if to assist him to his
feet, the Russian uttered a sharp cry; he collapsed in
their hands; something fell to the pavement with a clatter;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
and then one of the three men cried out in accents
of horror:</p>

<p>“Good heaven, the fellow has stabbed him! The
man has been stabbed!”</p>

<p>They dropped their burden and rushed at Nick. As
if by magic, two more men appeared, and they also
rushed forward. They surrounded the detective—and
he, taken entirely unawares, startled by the accusation
that had been made, was seized by them before he
realized what had happened.</p>

<p>Then, as the five men lifted their voices in outcries
of “Murder!” “Help!” “Police!” and kindred words,
Nick Carter’s wit told him what must be the explanation
of the scene. He realized that he would be a
helpless member of the community indeed if he should
be caught there in such a predicament with these five
witnesses against him.</p>

<p>Instantly he laid about him with his arms and fists.
He called into play every ounce of strength that he
possessed. He scattered those five men about him
as if they were so many straws. He piled them into a
heap beside the fallen Turnieff—and then he permitted
discretion to control him, and, hearing answering
shouts of men approaching, he tore himself loose
finally and fled.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, as he now understood
them, it was the only thing to do.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.
<br />
<small>MURDER.</small></h2>


<p>All Washington was excited the following morning,
anent the murder of Colonel Alexis Turnieff.</p>

<p>There were extras of the morning papers on the
streets, in which the full particulars were given, and
summed up into one paragraph, an epitome of the accounts
of the crime was about like this:</p>

<p>Turnieff had been one of the guests at the reception
given last night by Countess Narnine, at her home in
K Street. There had been another guest there who
had arrived and departed within less than an hour.
That guest had been seen by many persons, but was
not personally known to any of them save the countess
herself. That he passed under the name of Carter,
was admitted, but no first name was given, and the
countess asserted that she did not remember it. It
was said that the man called Carter had in some way
given offense to the countess, although she utterly
refused to discuss that point with any person. It
was sufficient, however, that she had asked him to
leave her house, and a servant had shown the man to
the door.</p>

<p>Colonel Alexis Turnieff, supposed to have been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
witness to the affront offered the countess and avowedly
in love with her, although hopelessly so, had followed
the stranger from the house. The two had met
in the street outside; there had been words and a hand-to-hand
struggle. At the end of it, Turnieff had fallen
to the pavement, stabbed to the heart, and he had never
spoken again.</p>

<p>Three men—their names were given—passing along
the avenue at the opposite side had seen the beginning
and the end of the struggle. At first they had not
thought to interfere, but finally had rushed forward,
just at the moment when Turnieff had fallen, stabbed
to death by the man with whom he had been fighting.</p>

<p>Even then the three men had not suspected what had
happened. They supposed that Turnieff had merely
been knocked down and had rushed to his assistance;
but on attempting to lift him to his feet, they discovered
that he had received his death wound.</p>

<p>They had called for help. Two other men, unknown
to them till then, had rushed to their assistance, and
the five together had endeavored to hold the murderer.
But the strength of the man had proven to be prodigious.
He had torn himself away from them. He
had piled them into a heap upon the pavement. He
had made his escape.</p>

<p>Then other men came to the rescue, among them two
policemen. They had pursued the murderer; but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
terrible man had made good his escape and disappeared.</p>

<p>The city was being scoured for him. Every nook
and corner of it was being searched. A fairly good
description of him had been obtained, and the chief
of police gave it as his opinion that the fellow would
quickly be apprehended.</p>

<p>In the meantime the “murderer”—that terrible fellow
who had thrown five men into an ignominious
heap on the pavement <em>had</em> made good his escape, although
for a time it seemed that it might be impossible
for him to do so.</p>

<p>Nick Carter had never been in quite such a predicament
as that one, and he realized on the instant that
he decided to run for it, that his reputation would not
save him. His life, or at least his liberty, would be
sworn away by those five hired assassins who had
taken advantage of the opportunity offered to rid the
principals who hired them, of a man who had become
obnoxious.</p>

<p>For so Nick Carter read the truth of the incident.</p>

<p>Doubtless the life of Turnieff had already been
sworn away by the spies of that unnamed country,
which, for the purpose of this story, had been called
Siam, but which, of course, was not Siam.</p>

<p>Doubtless it had already been decreed that Turnieff
should die that night, after he came away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
reception at the home of the countess. More than
likely the five men who appeared so opportunely for
their own purposes upon the scene would have murdered
the Russian anyway, before he reached his own
home. In the quarrel with Nick Carter they had seen
an opportunity not only to accomplish what they had
been ordered to do, but to cast the blame of it upon
another.</p>

<p>Nick regarded it merely as a coincidence that that
other should have been himself. He did not associate
the murder with that other incident of the night, at
the house of the countess. He did not connect her
with it, although there were moments when he thought
of doing so.</p>

<p>The thing that the crime did tell the detective was
this: That Turnieff had been in some way instrumental
in the theft of the tin cylinder with its contents,
from the house of the ambassador, and that his
usefulness was over. Considering him a weakling
who might at any time betray them, he had been sacrificed.</p>

<p>And yet—the matter was most opportune.</p>

<p>There was always the possibility that the countess
had seen in Turnieff’s anger at Nick Carter for the
supposed affront an opportunity of ridding herself
of two dangerous men—Turnieff and Nick Carter.</p>

<p>But Nick knew that even if he could ultimately establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
his own innocence, there was sure to be much
inconvenience and trouble connected with it. He realized
when he saw through the thing that the best
way for him to do was to get out of sight, and to
keep out of sight until he could clear up the mystery
and apprehend the real murderers.</p>

<p>That was why he ran away.</p>

<p>That was why, after he had made good his escape,
he directed his steps straight for the embassy and
roused the ambassador from his slumbers.</p>

<p>For the detective had been provided with a means
of entering that house at any hour of the day or night
without calling upon the servants to admit him. When
he entered it that night, he took himself straight to
the room where the big teester bed was located, and
where the ambassador slept.</p>

<p>Nobody saw the detective enter the house; nobody
but the ambassador was aware of his presence there;
and Nick’s first words to the Russian were a shock
to him. He said:</p>

<p>“Turnieff has been sacrificed, prince. I do not
know that he is dead, but I fear that he is.”</p>

<p>“My God!” cried the ambassador.</p>

<p>And then with deliberation Nick recounted all that
occurred at the house of the countess, the quarrel in
the street that followed it—and the crime.</p>

<p>“You had the forethought to escape,” said the ambassador,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
when he was able to speak after he had
heard the story. “Heavens, Mr. Carter, think of the
fix you would be in if you had been captured.”</p>

<p>The detective smiled, though sadly.</p>

<p>“I have thought of it,” he said. “I thought of it
then, and I had to think very quickly, too. On the
whole, I believe that those men were not sorry to
have me get away from them, since it saved them
the necessity of swearing away the life of an innocent
man; although I have very little idea that they
would have hesitated at that.”</p>

<p>“Hesitated? Not at all. Poor Turnieff! First the
father; now the son. It is awful! But, Mr. Carter,
I see men fall about me all the time. The life of
a man is not considered where the schemes of a government
are at stake. What a terrible woman!”</p>

<p>“Eh? Why do you say that, prince?”</p>

<p>“Because there can be no doubt, not the slightest,
that she set those men upon you.”</p>

<p>The detective shook his head in a positive negative.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “I do not think so.”</p>

<p>“You do not? Why not?”</p>

<p>“For several reasons, the chief one being because it
would have been bad policy on her part. Then there
are minor reasons. For example, there was not time
for her to arrange it. She could not know that I
would stop on the corner near her house, puzzled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
by the experiences of the night, and that Turnieff
would overtake me there. For if I had not stopped
there for five minutes or more, he would not have
found me and there would have been no quarrel.”</p>

<p>“And he would still be among the living.”</p>

<p>“No; I do not think so.”</p>

<p>“You do not? Why?”</p>

<p>“Prince, hasn’t it occurred to you that in order
that this affair could happen just as it did, those men
must have been there on the watch?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But——”</p>

<p>“Wait. If they were there on the watch, they
saw me leave the house, did they not?”</p>

<p>“Supposedly so.”</p>

<p>“Well, they permitted me to go my way unmolested.
If they had received instructions concerning me, they
would hardly have done that. No, they were watching
and waiting for Turnieff, intending that he should
die—intending to kill him. I had no place in that
plot. It was hatched—it must have been—without
considering me, and only because they deemed it expedient
to get him out of the way. He would have
been killed just the same—only it would have been a
mysterious crime, and no person would have been
directly charged with it.”</p>

<p>“I see what you mean.”</p>

<p>“If I had not stopped at that corner, where I remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
certainly five minutes if not longer before Turnieff
overtook me, he would not have found me at
all. I should have gone around the next corner.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right; and yet——”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“It does look to me like the work of that woman’s
craft.”</p>

<p>“It looks so on the face of it; yes. But when one
stops to analyze it, it does not. She could not have
arranged it in the time allowed, even if it had occurred
to her—and honestly, I do not think that she
knew of the attack that was to be made on Turnieff.
It was necessary that she should have known of that
in order to have involved me in it.”</p>

<p>“You are defending her, Carter.”</p>

<p>“No; I am merely being just to her.”</p>

<p>“But poor Turnieff is dead, and he has been killed
by the men with whom she is working.”</p>

<p>“We surmise that; but we do not know it. Even
if it is so, it does not follow that she is in any way
accountable for his murder, or that she knew that it
was decreed.”</p>

<p>“I think it does. Anyhow I shall act on that belief.”</p>

<p>“As you please, prince.”</p>

<p>“But, Carter, what are you to do now?”</p>

<p>“I am to work this case out to the end, I believe;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
and incidentally, I shall seek and find the men who
murdered Turnieff, and who would have charged me
with the crime.”</p>

<p>“Good. I believe you will do it. But how? You
are a suspected man, Carter. You cannot go abroad
in the streets now as you would have done. The
papers will be filled with talk about you.”</p>

<p>“I know it. I am anxious to see them. But I
shall go about in the streets just the same, prince.
I have not studied the art of disguising myself for
nothing. Really, the case has just begun.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.
<br />
<small>BARE-FACED JIMMY’S DOUBLE.</small></h2>


<p>Nick Carter, after he escaped from his pursuers
that night, and could take it more easily for the remainder
of the distance he wished to go, had thought
deeply. Even before he had the interview which followed
with the ambassador, he had determined upon
his future course of action.</p>

<p>Since Turnieff had been murdered, evidently in
cold blood, and merely to get rid of him, the detective
was convinced that the Russian colonel had been the
real instrument in the theft of the tin cylinder and
its contents.</p>

<p>Whether Juno had engineered and directed the affair
or not was a mere incident in the matter. There
was no longer any doubt in the mind of Nick Carter
that Turnieff had been the really guilty one.</p>

<p>And that Turnieff had had it in his power to betray
those whom he had served in performing the act—and
might have done so, if driven to it—was sufficient
cause for his untimely taking off, from the
standpoint of those who had ordered his assassination.</p>

<p>Again Turnieff was really the only person who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
could have had access to the sleeping room of the
ambassador, and who could have gone through the
corridors of the house toward it, or have returned
through them from it, without exciting suspicion.
After all, the ambassador had been wiser than he
realized in directing the detective to study the man
thoroughly and well.</p>

<p>But Juno, “The Leopard,” where was she in the
matter?</p>

<p>During that conversation with Nick in the conservatory,
she had said enough to make it plain to him
that she was really in the service of that country which
they had agreed to call Siam.</p>

<p>Practically she had admitted as much when she
charged him with being in the employ of Russia.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Nick could not bring himself to the
belief that she had taken any part in the assassination
of Turnieff, actively or passively, or that she had
knowledge of the intention to kill him.</p>

<p>He believed that in that respect she had been
maligned. He believed the statements she had made
in regard to herself at the time of that conservatory
conversation, and he looked upon her now as not half
so bad as she had been painted, or as she had permitted
others to believe her.</p>

<p>Her conduct toward him when she drove him away
from her home left no sting after it, for, after all, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
was part of the game, and it was up to her to take all
the tricks she could take. Aside from the assassination,
Nick had a notion that the country Juno was
serving had more of right on its side than Russia
did.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Nick had pledged himself to recover
those secret documents for the ambassador, and he
meant to do so; and now that Turnieff had been killed,
he had promised himself that the assassins should
be caught.</p>

<p>“Whether Juno is the person sought in this case or
not, she is the real key to the situation,” he told himself;
and believing that, he made arrangements for the
next move.</p>

<p>He had determined now to move quickly. The
murder of Turnieff should not go unpunished, nor
would he consent that he should himself be thought
guilty of such a crime if it could be avoided.</p>

<p>By the time he had finished his talk with the ambassador,
morning had come; and the ambassador, at
the detective’s request, arose much earlier than usual,
and went forth to make some purchases for Nick,
since it was not safe at that time to trust another
with the errand.</p>

<p>The things he wanted were the necessities for the
disguise he had determined to wear when night should
fall again, and in the meantime he intended to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
very quiet indeed within the house of the ambassador.</p>

<p>When the prince returned with the articles needed,
he brought with him several of the morning papers,
and Nick learned from their contents the exact status
of affairs at that time. After he had discussed the
matter to some further extent with the ambassador,
he shut himself in a room and began to make the transformation
in his appearance which now seemed so
necessary.</p>

<p>“Once there was a man who called himself Bare-Faced
Jimmy,” he said to himself with a smile as he
regarded his own reflection in the mirror of the room,
“and now I shall proceed to bring that man—although
he is in Sing Sing prison at the present moment—into
this room for my especial benefit.”</p>

<p>Much had been said about the ability of Nick Carter
in the way of disguises. It was an art that his
father had taught him, and which he had studied in all
its branches ever since then, at every time and place
where opportunity offered. One of the things that
Nick Carter could do, and do well, was to make himself
like another person, provided that stature and
physical development were approximately the same.</p>

<p>Nick’s first occupation in arranging the present disguise
was to make a careful drawing of Jimmy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
this, when he began to manufacture the actual disguise,
he pinned against the wall beside the mirror.</p>

<p>Midnight found the detective in the vicinity of the
home of Juno, Countess Narnine. He studied the
dwelling for a time, and then walked away from it,
satisfied that he would have no difficulty in carrying
his design into execution.</p>

<p>He satisfied himself on another point also, and that
was that Juno was not only at home, but that she had
denied herself to all callers; for he saw several persons
approach the door of her home, only to be turned
away again by the servants.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if the murder of Turnieff and
the hue and cry after me, as a consequence of the
crime, has got on her nerves,” he told himself.</p>

<p>At two in the morning he was back again near the
house. This time, watching for his opportunity, he
sprang over the fence, for the house was a detached
one, crept through the shrubbery, and presently approached
a side door which he had selected for the
beginning of his operations.</p>

<p>He did not know that, during his absence between
midnight and two o’clock, three men had called there,
had been admitted, and were even at that moment
in consultation with Juno in the library of her home.</p>

<p>Perhaps, if he had known it, it would only have
rendered him the more eager to proceed with the undertaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
in hand; at all events, he did go ahead
with it.</p>

<p>It consisted, first, in using his picklock upon that side
door; a small instrument of his own invention of
which he often had occasion to make use.</p>

<p>A chain bolt inside the door was quickly snipped
through by nippers he had brought with him for that
purpose, and he stood inside the home of Juno shortly
after two o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>His pocket flashlight showed him the way around.
He pressed the button of it long enough to determine
his course, and went ahead slowly and cautiously,
and so he arrived in the main hallway at the front of
the house, from which point he knew his way fairly
well.</p>

<p>There was more light burning in the hall than he had
expected to find there, and he decided that Juno might
not have retired as yet. As he bent his head to listen
he could plainly hear the murmur of voices from some
place not far away, which he rightly judged to be the
library.</p>

<p>Nick knew the location of the library from his
visit to the house the preceding night. He knew that
it communicated with one of the parlors of the house
which was directly in front of it, and so he passed
through the hall to the parlor door and entered that
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>At once the voices became more distinct, though
as yet he could not determine words of the conversation.
He crept forward and drew the heavy curtain
a trifle aside from the doorway that connected the
two rooms.</p>

<p>As he did so, he started back so suddenly that he
almost betrayed himself, for Juno at that moment, expressing
something about the closeness of the room,
left her chair, came directly toward him, and with
a quick motion pulled the curtain all the way back.</p>

<p>It was a miracle that she did not discover him, but
she did not, and Nick understood the reason why. It
was because she was greatly exercised with the matter
she had in hand at the moment.</p>

<p>She wheeled about where she stood, facing the
others in the room, who were seated at a table whereon
were bottles, glasses, and cigars. There were three
men there, and Juno faced them from the curtained
doorway, standing with one of her hands still grasping
the curtain. She was angry. Nick could see that
at once.</p>

<p>“There is absolutely no use in discussing the matter
further,” she told them in a tone which was emphatic.
“I will not countenance what has happened, and I will
have nothing more to do with you or with your crowd
of assassins. You may go your ways. That is final.
I am sorry that I ever came here at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>“Beware, my purring leopard,” said one of the men
in reply, with a short and not pleasant laugh. “You
may find that you call us assassins to some purpose.”</p>

<p>“You threaten me?” she demanded, her lips curling
with contempt.</p>

<p>“Yes, countess, I threaten you.”</p>

<p>“You would murder me, doubtless, as you murdered
poor Turnieff.”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” replied the man coolly. “Very certainly,
if you defy us.”</p>

<p>“Bah! As if I feared you! You—was it you who
struck the blow, Delorme? Was it you who stabbed
Turnieff to death? You would stab me also; eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It was I. His death was necessary, and if
it should happen that you were in the way, my fair one,
you could die quite as easily.”</p>

<p>She laughed at him deliberately, mockingly. She
bent forward toward him, still holding her grasp upon
the curtain.</p>

<p>“You are a brute and a coward, Maurice Delorme!”
she exclaimed. “But—have you forgotten the tin
cylinder with its contents? What would you do without
that? Offer to do me the least harm, and I will
return it to the Russian ambassador.”</p>

<p>“By heaven, you shall give it up now!” cried Delorme,
leaping to his feet and starting toward her;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
but he had not taken the second step in that direction
when Juno was seized from behind, pulled backward
through the open doorway and Maurice Delorme found
himself facing a man instead of a woman. The man
was coolly pointing a pistol at his heart and commanding
him to throw up his hands or take the consequences.</p>

<p>Nick Carter had not anticipated any such development
as this, when he determined to enter the house
of the Countess Narnine as a burglar would. He had
intended, then, merely to personate Jimmy, to surprise
Juno, and if possible to force a confession of some sort
from her.</p>

<p>But here was a gathering of the very men he wanted
to find, at her house. And here she was resenting what
they had done in murdering the Russian officer; defying
them to their faces, and admitting in his hearing
that she could place her hand upon the papers he was
seeking. And more, here was the confessed murderer
of Turnieff, with two of his accomplices.</p>

<p>Nor would Nick have interrupted the scene just
when he did had he not realized the necessity of immediate
action.</p>

<p>He had seen enough to know that Delorme was
ugly, and to understand that the man was quite capable
of killing Juno then and there.</p>

<p>Indeed, Delorme afterward confessed that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
countess would not have lived a moment longer had
Nick Carter not appeared when he did.</p>

<p>Nick saw the flame in the man’s eyes; he saw the
temper the fellow was in. The detective realized that
he must act at once, and so he snatched Juno out of
danger, whipped out his own weapons and took her
place, getting the “drop” on all of the three men at
once.</p>

<p>And they did not know him.</p>

<p>Had he been Nick Carter in proper person, they
would have done so; but in his character of Bare-Faced
Jimmy, he was a stranger to them.</p>

<p>More than that, when he seized Juno, dragged her
back away from Delorme, and took her place, they
heard her cry out in evident consternation:</p>

<p>“<em>Jimmy!</em>”</p>

<p>They were frightened.</p>

<p>They did not dare to move, and doubtless they supposed
that it would be possible to temporize.</p>

<p>In obedience to the stern command that the detective
uttered, they raised their hands high above
their heads and held them there, staring. The two
revolvers he held, one in either hand, with the muzzles
wavering from one to another and keeping each of
them constantly covered, confirmed a sufficiently convincing
argument.</p>

<p>“Juno?” said Nick without turning his head, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
for the moment forgetting to imitate the voice of
James Duryea.</p>

<p>She stared for a moment without replying. Then
she moved forward until she stood near him, still
staring.</p>

<p>“Yes?” she replied. And then as if impelled by a
second thought she added: “What is it, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>Nick chuckled. He knew from the manner of her
reply that he had already betrayed himself, but that
she preferred to accept the deception as fact. Then
he spoke calmly.</p>

<p>“I want you to know,” he said, still keeping the
pistols wavering so that they covered all three of the
men, “that I believe all that you said to me in that
last interview we had. And now will you help me to
do something? Will you, Juno?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I will help. You want me to disarm those
men?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Tell them that you know me; that if they
make the slightest move I’ll drop every one of them
with a bullet; not dead, you understand; just maimed.
I’ll shoot one knee out from under each one of them.
Now go ahead, Juno. Be careful there, mister man,
you who are called Maurice Delorme.</p>

<p>“You look ugly and you would commit murder if
you had an opportunity; but you won’t get one. Did
you ever happen to hear of Bare-Faced Jimmy, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
gentleman burglar? Well, that’s me. I came here
just in time, didn’t I? I happened to see you—all three
of you—when you killed that Russian colonel last
night, so you didn’t have to make that confession we
just heard. Have you got ’em all, Juno?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Every one of them? Are you sure that you have
not overlooked a knife or a pistol, or a bottle of acid,
or poison?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure,” she smiled back at him.</p>

<p>“Good! Now, my festive assassins, turn around.
Your backs are more agreeable than your faces. That’s
right. Juno, take one of these pistols; I’ll keep the
other. Now, you three cutthroats, stand still. If you
move it means a broken knee for each of you. Juno,
I regret the necessity for taking down some of these
pictures on the walls, but I need the wire.”</p>

<p>Five minutes after that, bound hand and foot with
wire picture cord, the three men were lying on their
back on the floor of the library. Then, and not till
then, Juno stepped forward demurely and gave the
pistol back to Nick Carter.</p>

<p>“We will leave those fellows where they are for the
present, Juno,” the detective said. “They can’t get
away. That wire cord is too strong for them, and
I am too good an expert in its use. Have you another
room to which you can take me, countess?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied. “Come with me.”</p>

<p>He followed her and she led him through the hall
and up the broad stairway to the parlor of her own
private suite. There she turned about and faced him.</p>

<p>“Why did you make yourself so like Jimmy?” she
demanded. It was the last thing he expected her to
say.</p>

<p>“Because I realized the necessity of another interview
with you, and because I thought that for a few
moments at least I could deceive you.”</p>

<p>“You might have done so indeed, for a moment; but
not for long. But why did you wish to do it?”</p>

<p>“Juno, every wish that I had was built upon the desire
to recover possession of the tin cylinder, which I
was sure you held in your possession. To-night I have
heard you admit that you have it. I want it, Juno.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I should refuse it?”</p>

<p>“In that case I would keep on searching till I
discovered it; that is all.”</p>

<p>She came a step nearer to him.</p>

<p>“You saved my life to-night, Nick Carter. Do
you realize that? That man would have killed me.
You appeared on the scene just in time.”</p>

<p>“That is why I appeared,” he replied.</p>

<p>“I owe you something for that, my friend. But
first of all, I owe you an apology—for what I said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
and did when you were here at my reception. Will
you forgive me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is all in the game, Juno. I think I admired
you when you did it. It was a very plucky
thing to do.”</p>

<p>“No. That is a mistake. It was not a plucky thing
to do; it was a despicable thing for me to do. Will
you forgive it? Say yes, if you mean it.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Wholly. Entirely. And now——”</p>

<p>“Before we refer to the tin cylinder and the papers
it contains, will you do me a favor, please?” she interrupted
him.</p>

<p>“I think so. What is it?”</p>

<p>“That door opens into a lavatory. Go in there
and remove the disguise. Let me talk to you as Nick
Carter; not as what you appear to be.”</p>

<p>Without a word he turned away. Five minutes
later he was back again, and stood before her with not
a trace of the disguise left upon him. He noticed that
she was holding in one of her hands the tin cylinder
about which so much had been done, and which had
been the cause of so many things happening.</p>

<p>With only a few words of comment, she placed it
in his hands.</p>

<p>“Take it,” she said. “I hate it and all that is
connected with it. Somehow I feel as if I were responsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
for the death of poor Turnieff, although I
swear to you——”</p>

<p>“You need not, Juno. I am already convinced of
that much.”</p>

<p>“But I had nothing to do with the theft of it. I
did not even ask him to get it for me or if it was in
his power to get it. Once I did mention those papers
to him, and say that if I could get possession of them
my fortune would be made. Then one day he brought
them to me—and I hated him for it; hated him for the
weakling he was. I did not come here in the service
of that country that wanted the papers. It was only
after I arrived here that I was induced to take part
in their affairs; but I swear to you that I have never
done one single thing for them, or abetted one of their
acts, which could reflect upon me in the slightest
degree. Oh, please believe me, Nick Carter.”</p>

<p>“I do believe you, Juno.”</p>

<p>“One more thing and I have done. I want to swear
to you again that I had nothing to do with the death
of Turnieff’s father. Maurice Delorme did that, too,
I believe, although I do not know. The money and
the jewels that were stolen from the old prince I
never saw out of his possession, although I think that
Delorme could explain about that part of it, too. And
now, now——”</p>

<p>She turned her back to him for a moment, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
waited. After a little she turned about again, and
raising her head proudly, asked:</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with me?”</p>

<p>“I am going to give you a bit of advice, Juno;
that is all. It is that you give up the life of an international
spy, and of a diplomatic agent, and live the
life that will make you happy. That is all.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After a time she asked him:</p>

<p>“What will you do with those men downstairs, Nick
Carter?”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking about that,” he replied to her.
“It would not do for them to be taken to jail from your
home. I will telephone for the ambassador from here.
He will send a closed carriage. We will bundle these
men into it—and, unless I greatly mistake, he will
know how to handle the situation.”</p>

<p>And the ambassador did know.</p>

<p>Just how it was done nobody ever discovered, but
the men made a full confession, and ultimately they
suffered the extreme penalty of the law in such cases.</p>

<p>Another thing: Bare-Faced Jimmy Duryea, with
the many aliases, died that same night in the prison
where he was confined.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&trade;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
